I am sorry, strange friend. There isn't much left on any of these.
A pearl can only take so much exposure to the environment before the data inside is burned away. All that is left now is a pale white image. I can only make out single pieces of it.
You could give these to the scavengers, however. Their fascination for shiny objects has probably not changed! I'm sure these will find a better use in one of their collections.
