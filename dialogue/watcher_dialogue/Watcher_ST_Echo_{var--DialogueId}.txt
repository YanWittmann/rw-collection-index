OA!
MMMMMMMMM. Company.
...
It seems so cold here now.
The metal all a-droop.
all a-rust.
Looks bad. Bent. Old. Dead. Dusty.
Bleh.
...
Still, it reminds me of my creche days.
I could run these halls back when.
I was so fast! No-one could catch me!
OAOAOAOAOAOA!!!!

Ho! Hum! Hi! He!
A pin for creche!
A petal for spawn!
A drop of juice!
He! Hum! WA! Ho!
A bowl, a jar, a length of twine!

I love that song, don't you?
My nest mothers would sing it to me.

OA OA, it is my shadow. I have been watching you.
It is nice to have a companion, after all this time.
For so long I have drifted. Lost.
Dispersed in the multitudes of the waves and the ripples.
But following your thread brings me closer, perhaps, to how I was.

OAOA! How is it then?
To be an animal.
Or are you still?
...
No. Not after all this time, and distance.
A small god.
TINY.
A godlet!
But still can be eaten! OAOAOA!
A tasty little god sausage! OAOAOAOAOAOA!

OA! Hallo my shadow!
...
Bleh you shouldn’t have come here.
It is too far.
Blech, bleh. I hate it.
Gross gross gross.
...
After a point it’s all like this.
Glip glop everywhere. Sea of lumps, forever.
So glad I cannot sniff!
Spoiled meat, dissolving proteins. Yeeck.
Let's away.
