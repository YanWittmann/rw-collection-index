mapInfo: Spinning Top can be encountered in any order in these regions.\nSeven Encounters are necessary to unlock the Shattered Terrace to Ancient Urban portal.
info: To determine what dialogue to display for each encounter,\nthe game (mainly) uses the min and max Ripple Level of the player.\nAfter the Vanilla intro, the min/max Ripple Levels are both 1.\nThe max Ripple Level increases by 0.5 for each encounter, with the min Level trailing behind by 2.\nThe Level cap of 5.0 corresponds to the ten Karma levels the player can reach.

OA OA, it is my shadow. I have been watching you.
It is nice to have a companion, after all this time.
For so long I have drifted. Lost.
Dispersed in the multitudes of the waves and the ripples.
But following your thread brings me closer, perhaps, to how I was.

Ho! Hum! Hi! He!
A pin for creche!
A petal for spawn!
A drop of juice!
He! Hum! WA! Ho!
A bowl, a jar, a length of twine!
...
I love that song, don't you?
My nest mothers would sing it to me.

OAOA! How is it then?
To be an animal.
Or are you still?
...
No. Not after all this time, and distance.
A small god.
TINY.
A godlet!
But still can be eaten! OAOAOA!
A tasty little god sausage! OAOAOAOAOAOA!

OA!
MMMMMMMMM. Company.
...
It seems so cold here now.
The metal all a-droop.
all a-rust.
Looks bad. Bent. Old. Dead. Dusty.
Bleh.
...
Still, it reminds me of my creche days.
I could run these halls back when.
I was so fast! No-one could catch me!
OAOAOAOAOAOA!!!!

OA! Hallo my shadow!
...
Bleh you shouldn’t have come here.
It is too far.
Blech, bleh. I hate it.
Gross gross gross.
...
After a point it’s all like this.
Glip glop everywhere. Sea of lumps, forever.
So glad I cannot sniff!
Spoiled meat, dissolving proteins. Yeeck.
Let's away.
