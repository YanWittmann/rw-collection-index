Ohh! Is it the same one?
Even here??
Even when??
Well well well well well.
Well. That IS new!
Do your trick, let me see.
OAOAOAOAOA!! Yess!!\nLook at those eyes! Peeping! PEEPING!
THEY might not, but I can always see you.
Never forget that, my little shadow.

OAOAOA! Yes here you are!
So tenacious! Even amongst this flotsam and jetsam!
These mindless swimmers and floaters.
Look! Do you see? A big one just ate a little one! OAOAOAOA!
Good! One less stinging idiot! OA! They prick at me so!

OA!
MMMMMMMMM. Company.
...
It seems so cold here now.
The metal all a-droop.
all a-rust.
Looks bad. Bent. Old. Dead. Dusty.
Bleh.
...
Still, it reminds me of my creche days.
I could run these halls back when.
I was so fast! No-one could catch me!
OAOAOAOAOAOA!!!!
