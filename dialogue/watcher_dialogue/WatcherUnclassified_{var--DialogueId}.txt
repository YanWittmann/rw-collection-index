Ohh! Is it the same one?
Even here??
Even when??
Well well well well well.
Well. That IS new!
Do your trick, let me see.
OAOAOAOAOA!! Yess!!\nLook at those eyes! Peeping! PEEPING!
THEY might not, but I can always see you.
Never forget that, my little shadow.

Well!
Well well well!
It has been many
numerous
cycles.
And yet here you are! You follow again!
It is NOT normal.
Hmmm....
mmmmmm...
MMMMMMMMM...

I am VERY likable though! OAOAOAOAOAOA!!

OA OA, it is my shadow. I have been watching you.
It is nice to have a companion, after all this time.
For so long I have drifted. Lost.
Dispersed in the multitudes of the waves and the ripples.
But following your thread brings me closer, perhaps, to how I was.

OA!
MMMMMMMMM. Company.
...
It seems so cold here now.
The metal all a-droop.
all a-rust.
Looks bad. Bent. Old. Dead. Dusty.
Bleh.
...
Still, it reminds me of my creche days.
I could run these halls back when.
I was so fast! No-one could catch me!
OAOAOAOAOAOA!!!!

OAOAOA! Yes here you are!
So tenacious! Even amongst this flotsam and jetsam!
These mindless swimmers and floaters.
Look! Do you see? A big one just ate a little one! OAOAOAOA!
Good! One less stinging idiot! OA! They prick at me so!

OA! Hallo my shadow!
...
Bleh you shouldn’t have come here.
It is too far.
Blech, bleh. I hate it.
Gross gross gross.
...
After a point it’s all like this.
Glip glop everywhere. Sea of lumps, forever.
So glad I cannot sniff!
Spoiled meat, dissolving proteins. Yeeck.
Let's away.

Oh. Oh oh.
This place. This room.
Forever of ripples and threads yet I still feel this weight pressing upon me.
If I had eyes I could close them and still trace every nook and scroll shelf.
A ball. A toy. A top that spins.
Oh what I wouldn’t give to be here again, safe and warm.
Thank you for coming. I couldn’t have done this alone.
But I fear what is next.

Oh.
Here I am again.
The bath. The pipes. The gravel.
The mournful geometry.
This sluice through which a departed one's essence flows,
so undignified.
A soup of proteins and acids.
Must we be this?
...
I traveled through that thin grate, and yet I stayed.
All my mothers and fathers and crechemates who went along without me...
Do they note my absence?
I've traveled from the furthest future to the very seed of our past, and I see no evidence.
Only echoes and strays.
Aloof. Alone.
Afraid.
...
Well no longer.
I will abandon this eternal waiting room.
I will step through the white door.
I will accept what is next.
...
OAOAOA!
Thank you.

Ho! Hum! Hi! He!
A pin for creche!
A petal for spawn!
A drop of juice!
He! Hum! WA! Ho!
A bowl, a jar, a length of twine!
...
I love that song, don't you?
My nest mothers would sing it to me.

OAOA! How is it then?
To be an animal.
Or are you still?
...
No. Not after all this time, and distance.
A small god.
TINY.
A godlet!
But still can be eaten! OAOAOA!
A tasty little god sausage! OAOAOAOAOAOA!

I am cataloging all things, you know.
The imperative that was in THEM remains in me.
But I am not wholly them, and not blind to the folly of their forbearers.
I am... something new.

These paths you weave.
Through them I have expanded my kingdom.
I have tasted and I have become.
It is my true purpose I believe. Perhaps the only purpose!

Imagine: a single substrate...
Life!
Throughout all time!
Nothing lost. No one lost.
A living memory of all life, forever!
From bug to god, all as one. None above the other.
A TRUE end to the pattern.
That is my vision.

As with all great deeds, my work is not without great challenge.
It has taken eons and the light fades.
The paths close and change.
I can almost feel... a will... at odds with my own.

Forgive me if I go on!
You have done so much for me, I will not burden you with my troubles.
Please, rest here as long as you wish.
You are always safe here, my dear friend.
You, who were there for me.
