Oh my! You have grown... and you have become!
The scent...
yes....
Yes!! I percieve it now!
Paths crossed and intertwined! Across such time and distance...
How fantastic our fates!
How wonderous you are, to me.
Alpha and Omega.

And so we have arrived at the endgame.
We have each played our hands,
and it is for fate to decide.
For my part, I have so enjoyed our journey together.
From nothing... to gods.
Think of me well.
My dear friend.

Ah my friend!
It has been so long,
I was afraid you wouldn't come.
Please, sit and rest.
...
Here we are, at the end of it all.
...
What a lovely view.

Oh, before you go... a gift.
Perhaps I am not so different after all.
