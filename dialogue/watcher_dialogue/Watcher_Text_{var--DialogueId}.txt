Ho, the joy to be alone, among the reeds and the dancing yan flies with such a secret!
The beating of respiration resonates through the very density of my bones, to jangle the golden coins and the wires along my ears, creating a sweet percussion song of thirst and yearning!
My mask unclasped, I feel the balmy caress of the sun. Ho, joy! For even amongst the many shining in the grand court, that they have perceived... Me.
Scroll 47f of The Counselor's Consort
