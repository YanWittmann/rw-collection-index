You again! Odd little thing, trembling. Peeping eyes.\nSO PEEPING OAOAOAOA!! But I suppose you must peep.
So many sharp teeth and claws in this meat world.
They look to grind up your sticks!! OAOAOAOAOAOA!!
...
Here, I will give you a gift.

OAOAOA! It is this thing! Have you really not been eaten?
Well well well well! Not in this strand, no.
But donâ€™t be too proud OAOAOA!! I can see your reflections, yes!!
Behold: Chomped by a flying thing!
Torn to ribbons by a crawling thing!
Pulled into the earth by wiggling things!! OAOAOAOAOA!!!
A world of teeth! and claws! and beaks! and pressures! and acids!
Forever-where and forever-when! OAOAOAOA!!!!
