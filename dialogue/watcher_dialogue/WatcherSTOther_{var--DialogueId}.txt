OAOAOA! Yes here you are!
So tenacious! Even amongst this flotsam and jetsam!
These mindless swimmers and floaters.
Look! Do you see? A big one just ate a little one! OAOAOAOA!
Good! One less stinging idiot! OA! They prick at me so!

Oh.
Here I am again.
The bath. The pipes. The gravel.
The mournful geometry.
This sluice through which a departed one's essence flows,
so undignified.
A soup of proteins and acids.
Must we be this?
...
I traveled through that thin grate, and yet I stayed.
All my mothers and fathers and crechemates who went along without me...
Do they note my absence?
I've traveled from the furthest future to the very seed of our past, and I see no evidence.
Only echoes and strays.
Aloof. Alone.
Afraid.
...
Well no longer.
I will abandon this eternal waiting room.
I will step through the white door.
I will accept what is next.
...
OAOAOA!
Thank you.
