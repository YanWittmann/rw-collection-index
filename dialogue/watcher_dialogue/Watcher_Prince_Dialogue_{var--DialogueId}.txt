The imperative that was in THEM remains in me.
But I am not wholly them, and not blind to the folly of their forbearers.
I am... something new.

Imagine: a single substrate...
Life!
Throughout all time!
Nothing lost. No one lost.
A living memory of all life, forever!
From bug to god, all as one. None above the other.
A TRUE end to the pattern.
That is my vision.

As with all great deeds, my work is not without great challenge.
It has taken eons and the light fades.
The paths close and change.
I can almost feel... a will... at odds with my own.

Forgive me if I go on!
You have done so much for me, I will not burden you with my troubles.
Please, rest here as long as you wish.
You are always safe here, my dear friend.
You, who were there for me.
