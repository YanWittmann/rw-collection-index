CONSIDER:
A droplet of rain pierces the still water.
A ripple, A ring, ever expanding.

CONSIDER:
Movement along the circumference of a ring.
From one eye a loop, from one eye a spiral, from one eye the motion of a line.

CONSIDER:
A second drop. A thousandth.
A multiplex of rings, spirals, interacting in countless ways.
A froth. A seeth. An effervescence of disruption!

NOW:
An understanding.
A path. A purpose.
Movement along the line, from distant to origin.
From spiral to loop. From loop to point.
An understanding!
