[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, No Significant Harassment
SRS: ...
NSH: What is the matter?
SRS: For what I'm about to admit, I know you'll tease me.
SRS: Despite that, I confess I am growing attached to the messenger I sent out.
NSH: Hah! So you've gotten a soft spot for it? ~
SRS: Well... Yes. They are a very expressive little creature...
NSH: I only recall that you used to be repulsed by them.
SRS: Yes, but with all the time I've invested, I've come to care for its safety.
SRS: Not only just because it's delivering an important message.
NSH: I am going to tell everyone this juicy information ~
SRS: No you are not!
NSH: I know, I kid.
SRS: Anyway... I just hope that it can return back to me safely. And perhaps forgive me for this difficult quest...
