[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, No Significant Harassment
NSH: You seem distracted. What's on your mind?
SRS: The little messenger I sent out. I'm worried for its safety.
NSH: I'm sure it'll be okay. You said it's built to withstand a lot of things.
SRS: Yes, but... the pearl was inside of the messenger's chest. Last time, Five Pebbles was very gentle and careful with removing it.
SRS: This time, he simply slashed open the chest and ripped the pearl out. The messenger was struggling to stand.
NSH: They're sturdy creatures. I'm sure it'll heal overtime. You have to have more faith.
SRS: You're right. I guess I'm just scared of losing them. I've grown more attached than I could've expected...
SRS: If I lost them as well, I don't know what I'd do.
