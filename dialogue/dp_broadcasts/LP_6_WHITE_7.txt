GS: So, what do you think is going to happen to the world? Once we all... you know.
HR: Discover a reproducable, portable, and global solution for ascension, or when we all drop dead?

HR: I don't think so. At least not for a very long time.
GS: Oh...
HR: ...
NGI: Transcendental Inversion! Transcendental Inversion!!
