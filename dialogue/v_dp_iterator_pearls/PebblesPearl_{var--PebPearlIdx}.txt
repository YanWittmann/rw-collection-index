It's an active working memory - raw data has been dropped here in order to later be pasted to a currently occupied memory conflux. Without context it's just a jumble.

It is the impression of being a small creature, like a wall climbing lizard, and looking up into the branches of a big tree. The last third is partly overwritten with a number series I vaguely recognize, but without my memoryâ€¦

A common prayer mantra repeated 7110 times. Each repetition has some slight random variations, which seem to have been written later.

Two... intertwined number series? I don't quite understand the utility of this.
It might a key for a cipher processor, customized for some other data which is impossible to infer from this.

It's qualia, or a moment - a very short one. Someone is holding a black stone, and twisting it slightly as they drag their finger across the rough surface.

It's just an active working memory, I can't really tell you anything without the context.

Without the process surrounding this data there isn't much I can tell you. It might have something to do with Void Fluid simulation...

This one is completely blank. Actually, blanker than blank, it must have been deliberately overwritten with repeating negative versions of itself for thousands of iterations.

A memory... but not really visual, or even concrete, in its character. It reminds of the feeling of a warm wind, but not the physical feeling but the... inner feeling.
I don't think it has much utility unless you are doing some very fringe Regeneraist research.
