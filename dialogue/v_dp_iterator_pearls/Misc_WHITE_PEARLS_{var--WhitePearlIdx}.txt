This is a movement acceptance invoice. It is nothing important.

=== transcription: LttM-post-collapse
md-var-WhitePearlIdx: 1
This is a movement acceptance invoice from one of the Dual Celia living blocks, as requested by Eight Bogs of the House of Eight during the Tan hegemonic architectural dynasty. All very standard stuff. I can't imagine that you'd be interested.

This is just a useless diamond sphere. Regardless of that, the light of my chamber shining through it is pleasing.

=== transcription: LttM-post-collapse
md-var-WhitePearlIdx: 2
Unfortunately I can't read this as it isn't a memory construct pearl. This is just a simple diamond sphere, as worthless as the carbon it's printed from.

"...through the mists of memory, your image dances, like the motes of dust, in a ray of sunlight, that pierces a dark room."
A line of verse from the ancient farmer-poet Pel. I have many of his works archived.

"...through the mists of memory, your image dances, like the motes of dust, in a ray of sunlight, that pierces a dark room."
A line of verse from the ancient farmer-poet Pel. Very dreary if you ask me.

"Fifteen stems of sun bark, hydrolyzed. Twelve to nineteen bushels of atomized chalk powder. Assorted Root vegetation..."
It goes on and on. A shopping list, or perhaps a recipe.

md-var-WhitePearlIdx: 5
I am sorry, this pearl is damaged and cannot be read. I suggest you use it for trade with the scavengers, as they won't know the difference.

=== transcription: LttM-post-collapse
md-var-WhitePearlIdx: 6
This is an official decree of cultivation sent from the twenty-second Subsistence Council ordering the eastern spoke Farm Array administration to "immediately harvest and process all viable crops, despite whatever misgivings they might have."
A short-sighted endeavor for sure. I would assume this was sent sometime during the final cycles leading up to final public ascension, when interest in biosphere sustainability was at an all-time low.

This is the schematic for a purposed organism. A refuse reclamation automaton. There is little a simple thing like you would understand if I explained it.

=== transcription: LttM-post-collapse
md-var-WhitePearlIdx: 7
Here we have a schematic for a refuse reclamation automaton. It's an early design, but the long tubular body and single eye-mouth are quite similar to the later models.

md-var-WhitePearlIdx: 8
"We, of the Five-hundred-and-ninety-second High Convocation of the True Anointed Citadel, do hereby demand, with full force of Law and Religious doctrine, an Immediate end to construction of the Apostate Superstructure Abomination. To place shadow upon the Divine Body of the True Anointed Citadel is outrageous blasphemy and cannot be tolerated, no matter the circumstances..."
Clearly this was ignored.

Oh, interesting. This is a diary entry of a pre-Iterator era laborer during the construction of the subterranean transit system south of here. In it they describe restless nights filled with disturbing dreams, where millions glowing stars move menacingly in the distance.

Such savagery. This pearl has been carved through as decoration. While the information within is not of any particular importance, the primitive methods used to drill through this pearl could have easily destroyed something more complex.
It is a shame to see them desecrate history for the sake of shiny trinkets.

=== transcription: LttM-post-collapse
md-var-WhitePearlIdx: 10
There isn't much to the data here, it's just basic theory for karmic transform of n-dimensional geometries.
But the pearl itself is quite interesting. You can see the crude holes burned through the center that the scavengers use to tie these pearls onto their totems or to carry. I honestly can't fathom how they achieve this with their primitive level of technology! Fascinating.

=== transcription: LttM-post-collapse
md-var-WhitePearlIdx: 11
This one is all blank, sorry.

=== transcription: LttM-post-collapse
md-var-WhitePearlIdx: 12
I am sorry, all of that work for nothing! This pearl is completely blank.

md-var-WhitePearlIdx: 13
There's nothing on this one, unfortunately.

I'm sorry, this one has nothing on it.

I can't make anything out of this pearl, it's just too faded. But there might have been something on it once.

=== transcription: FP-artificer
md-var-WhitePearlIdx: 17
This one has been cracked.

=== transcription: LttM-post-collapse
md-var-WhitePearlIdx: 17
This one has a small crack and has been pretty badly corrupted. There is a slight impression of the shape of a wing on it, but I can't get a clear image.

There's nothing on this one.

I see a vague memory of a family portrait, painted in the High Classical manner that was famous during the Yellow hegemonic literary dynasty. The portrait is likely a fake, as this style was quite fashionable for aspirational lower caste aristocrats to impress each-other with. This one does not impress, I assure you.

=== transcription: LttM-post-collapse
md-var-WhitePearlIdx: 20
It has been written to, but then scrambled, and then scrambled again. Suspicious behavior to be sure.

=== transcription: FP-artificer
md-var-WhitePearlIdx: 21
This data has been scrambled intentionally. It was likely used to store confidential information.

=== transcription: LttM-post-collapse
md-var-WhitePearlIdx: 21
This one has been purposefully scrambled, it's completely illegible. Business documents perhaps.

=== transcription: FP-artificer
md-var-WhitePearlIdx: 22
There is an image of banners on this, but it has been faded to the point of corruption.

=== transcription: LttM-post-collapse
md-var-WhitePearlIdx: 22
This one seems to have an image on it, but the pearl has been exposed to sunlight and it's very faded. I see a tall structure with banners unfurled.

=== transcription: LttM-post-collapse
md-var-WhitePearlIdx: 23
There might be something on here, but the pearl has been lying in the sun and it's all very pale. I'm too tired to look any deeper, I apologize.

It is growing instructions for the skeleton of a creature, nothing you would understand.

=== transcription: LttM-post-collapse
md-var-WhitePearlIdx: 24
This is a growing instruction for the skeleton of a creature, but I don't recognize the creature. It was small, about your size.

This one seems to be a number series... Perhaps a key?

=== transcription: FP-artificer
md-var-WhitePearlIdx: 26
Part of a number series. This was likely used as a cipher.

=== transcription: LttM-post-collapse
md-var-WhitePearlIdx: 26
A number series... I would guess some kind of cipher.

=== transcription: LttM-post-collapse
md-var-WhitePearlIdx: 27
This one is filled with active working memory - without knowing the surrounding process this information is meaningless.

md-var-WhitePearlIdx: 28
Strange, a singular number "8" has been written to this and nothing else.

=== transcription: LttM-post-collapse
md-var-WhitePearlIdx: 28
It just has the number "8" written on it, the rest is empty.

It is an old blueprint for construction supports.

md-var-WhitePearlIdx: 29
This is a blueprint for a support beam used for the construction of early industrial areas. You can see these in use not too far from here.

It's a design for a machine that makes bolts.

=== transcription: LttM-post-collapse
md-var-WhitePearlIdx: 31
It's a... recipe of some kind? "Two parts rot bar extract, one part bone ash." Nothing I recognize.

=== transcription: LttM-post-collapse
md-var-WhitePearlIdx: 32
It's an image of a hand drawn document. The calligraphy is quite beautiful, but the text itself is a very dull classical poem.

=== transcription: LttM-post-collapse
md-var-WhitePearlIdx: 33
This is the genome of a sulfur-processing microbe. In my opinion these were used far too late to have any effect.

=== transcription: LttM-post-collapse
md-var-WhitePearlIdx: 34
This one I don't know... It could be an old text, but some parts don't add up. Might be a re-imagination of a classic text that I'm not familiar with.

=== transcription: FP-artificer
md-var-WhitePearlIdx: 35
A classical hymn from an early dynasty. It is very short and repetitive, but its archiving will please me greatly.

=== transcription: LttM-post-collapse
md-var-WhitePearlIdx: 35
It's a song, or hymn rather. Very repetitive.

Can't make out anything legible on this one, sorry.

It's a catalog of bolts and screws for sky-sail joinery. We iterators were built for pragmatism, so it is an understatement to say that we were not known for our appreciation of beauty... but the sky-sails in flight during the big festivals always filled my soul with emotion.

I would prefer not to speak of the contents recorded in this pearl.
Some things are best left unknown.

No. I don't want to talk about the content of this pearl.

Old schematics for a gas filtration machine, very rough and unoptimized.

=== transcription: LttM-post-collapse

A schematic of a bunch of gas pipes. I don't know the purpose for this machine, but it doesn't look particularly well crafted.

=== transcription: LttM-post-collapse
md-var-WhitePearlIdx: 45
It's just the numbers 14, 13, 5, repeated over and over. I have no idea what the purpose for this would be.

This is an examination on various dilutions and chemical ratios for liquid mediums, and their resulting operating efficiencies when utilized to drive fluid-powered machinery. Not of interest to you at all I'm sure.

A small portion is still legible: "and Thus we Conclude, that Gold and Water shall..." Some sort of metaphysical or alchemical treatise perhaps.

md-var-WhitePearlIdx: 47
This contains the image of a pearl... and within that the same image. This is either a joke, or a method of testing a pearl's recursive density.

=== transcription: LttM-post-collapse
md-var-WhitePearlIdx: 47
Oh? This contains an image of another pearl just like it. Let me look... yes, as I thought, the image also contains an image of a pearl in it, and so on. Some comedian playing recursion games, I would guess.

It's a collection of photographs showcasing a group of monks contorting their bodies in various ways. Most amusing...

A description of a manually coded language developed late into the Yellow hegemonic dynasty. It utilized sequences of gestures and facial expressions to describe concepts to those incapable of speech. Too bad I cannot use this with you.

Could it be? This pearl contains the solution to the Big Problem in its entirety. My work is finally finished! At least that's what a dim-witted junkyard dweller like you seems to think will happen by bringing these to me. These pearls are a distraction.

This is a malicious pearl. The data is meaningless, but the way it is formatted would cause older machinery to get stuck in an infinite recursion trying to read it. Luckily, I am more sophisticated than that.
