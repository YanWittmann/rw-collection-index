The data on this one repeats itself many times, with a number of redundancy checks in place.
This extent of integrity checking is rarely seen, except when pearls have to be stored in highly contaminated environments where data corruption is likely.

The surface of this pearl is pristine, but the internal lattice is fractured beyond repair.
Something must have gone terribly wrong in the process of writing the data onto this.

A common prayer mantra repeated 7110 times. Each repetition has some slight random variations, which seem to have been written later.

It is a stored equipment manifest, showing rapidly deteriorating conditions over time. I suppose any equipment manifest you will find out there will look like this.

Two... intertwined number series? I don't quite understand the utility of this. It might be a key for a cipher processor, customized for some other data which is impossible to infer from this.

I don't understand this one. It is mostly blank, except for a small section at the start which appears to have been unsuccessfully written to hundreds of times. Perhaps by faulty machinery?

Incredible, this is seemingly a complete backup of an iterator's non-volatile core memory, transferred via the General Systems Bus. I don't recall such a thing ever being attempted to be stored in a pearl.
It's not even a compatible data format without substantial conversions.

This contains partial data that seems abruptly truncated. Whatever machinery was used to write this pearl must have been interrupted or suspended in the middle of its operation.

Without the process surrounding this data there isn't much I can tell you. It might have something to do with Void Fluid simulation...

This one is completely blank. Actually, blanker than blank, it must have been deliberately overwritten with repeating negative versions of itself for thousands of iterations.

Most of the data on this one is corrupted, but not through age. From the small bit that I can decipher, it appears that it may be a backup of some old conversation logs.
