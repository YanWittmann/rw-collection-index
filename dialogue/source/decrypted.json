It's hard to write both a smug, and angst-feeling character like him.\n\nWill: A lot of players seem to view him as simply a villain for what happened<LINE>between him and Moon, or even mistake the rot as an intentional creation.\n\nWill: The story itself in the base game is deeper then that, and Moon would never have<LINE>reason to treat him so closely if Five Pebbles was simply a jerk all along. She was a<LINE>big sister to him, and he did have his own relationship with Seven Red Suns.\n\nWill: I think we settled on the idea of a mix of helplessness, from something that is physically impossible<LINE>for slugcat to comprehend. His \"god like\" identity seems to be posturing, rather then just bragging.\n\nWill: Under that confidence he is still a dying machine. Eaten from the inside out.\n\nWill: His slow transition from anger to helplessness was based off one of Moon's neuron conversations.\n\nWill: Focusing Spearmaster as a sort of betrayal of trust, that SRS understood his goals, but<LINE>then to have the same friend return to them with the worry they might mess up. Only for Moon<LINE>to have caused that situation, and not himself, or at least in his isolated point of view!\n\nWill: We noticed his anger slowly subside by Hunter, even giving Moon his regards as he sends the player off.\n\nWill: Because of that Artificer would serve as a transition period of those two<LINE>states, and would give us the most interaction out of all the other slugcats."},{"n":"ss_e06-white.txt","p":"text_eng_v_dp\\ss_e06-white.txt","c":"0-ss_e06-white\nWill: Writing for an established character is something incredibly difficult.<LINE>Especially one with little screen time, but with such a big impression.\n\nWill: Straying too far in any direction can instantly create the sensation<LINE>of \"fan fiction,\" where a character suddenly acts only to further a plot.\n\nWill: Avoiding that is hard; one of the ways we tried to do so at first<LINE>was to only follow what was laid out in neuron and pearl conversations.\n\nWill: This fell apart as we reached Artificer as we had the chance to do<LINE>something unique with the character that was not possible to do before.\n\nWill: We had the chance for the player to interact with Five Pebbles at their<LINE>own pace. Instead of being rushed out of his room at the threat of death. As due<LINE>to the drone, he is unable to simply kill them without a justified reason.\n\nWill: Things kind of took on a life of their own. Initially his pearl dialog had more spite, and dislike of the player to them.\n\nWill: However, on specific topics it became interesting to get his insights on certain events, and some of his own pearls.\n\nWill: This created the idea that he might be a little bit of a history buff, or archivist,<LINE>excited to see when the player brings them something not yet documented.\n\nWill: Of course, he still doesn't let down his smug and prideful aura.
