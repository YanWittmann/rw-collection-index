The "KS" in "Prince_KS_*" stands for "Karma Sigil", as these conversations are tied to the karma sigil mechanics in the WORA_KarmaSigils class.

These are triggered in WORA_KarmaSigils under specific conditions:

For numberOfPrinceEncounters == 1:
 Prince_KS_1_1:
  Room: WORA_THRONE02
  Trigger Position: player.mainBodyChunk.pos.y >= 940f (near the first sigil)
  Tile Check: player.mainBodyChunk.pos.x >= 680f && player.mainBodyChunk.pos.x <= 940f

 Prince_KS_1_2:
  Room: WORA_THRONE02
  Trigger Position: player.mainBodyChunk.pos.y >= 2980f (near the second sigil)
  Tile Check:
   player.mainBodyChunk.pos.x <= 415f
   OR between 515f–570f
   OR between 750f–830f

 Prince_KS_1_3:

 Prince_KS_1_4:
  Room: WORA_AI
  Trigger Position: player.mainBodyChunk.pos.x <= 1810f (second checkpoint)
