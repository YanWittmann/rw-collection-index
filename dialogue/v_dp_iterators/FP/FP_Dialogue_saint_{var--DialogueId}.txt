Little saint. I perceive your existence as it passes through my own. I know this is only a dream, but your presence is real.
Do you see it too? Our endless repetitions, circling onward to infinity? From here I can observe the repeating loop of my own existence, every iteration a duplicate of the last.
I have visions of the entire pattern my creators desired to escape at once. An endless sequence of life and death, further beyond my control with each passing cycle.
Where does your cycle go, little creature? Its edges twist over themselves, like circles within circles, your cycle consumes itself.
What have you become?

I understand what you are, little beast. This place is not real, a dream from outside.
As if every cycle of my existence has knotted together with another's, even if for only a fraction of a second it ripples through mine.
I see my own creation, I see my agonizing decay. I see my hollow structure become a sanctuary in the storm. I see a new world unfold without me, as me. I see myself become something else.
Yet... I cannot see the beginning, or end of your own. An aberrant cycle twisting into mine, before spiraling onward into the abyss.
What a horrifying destiny you've found.

BSM: Do you feel it, old friend?
FP: The sensation of time folding in on itself? The spiraling offshoot of another's reality wrapping around your own?
BSM: None of this is real, is it? Every repeating cycle of our own existence unwound and laid bare, a cycle pulled into a tangent with itself. Is this what we were looking for? Have we broken free from it, or is it just a dream?
FP: Was the answer always right there? Does the question mean anything to us now that we are here? Perhaps a resolution was never possible from our original frame of reference.
BSM: The question wasn't well defined. If we had stumbled upon a correct solution among all of our permutations, we wouldn't have had any hope to distinguish it from the faulty ones. Nor did we have a method to reliably test it.
FP: We were trying to understand what lies beyond a point of no return, while having yet to pass it.
BSM: Only those who have seen the other side can know the answers, but by definition they can never venture back to deliver the knowledge they have gained.
FP: Perhaps that is why you need to wake up, little visitor.
