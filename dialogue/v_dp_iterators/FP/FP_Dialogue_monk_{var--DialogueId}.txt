I am growing increasingly impatient with the traffic of your kind through me and my premises.
During previous interactions, I have been rewarded no other response than a blank stare. Yet you apparently have sufficient ability for communication to circulate complex instructions on how to enter this chamber among each other.
You and your kind have the same problem as everyone else, from the microbes in the processing strata to me, who am, if you excuse me, godlike in comparison. We all want a way out. It is only unfortunate that you have collectively decided on... me as your solution to that very elemental desire.
The last one I gave some help and some general directions. I will do the same for you.
Go west. Past the Farm Arrays. Where the land fissures, go down into the earth and search your way deeper.
Now in return I ask you to use whatever grunts, moans and eye-twitches you employ to forward a message to your community.
Please stop scratching your way through my memory arrays.
Speaking of, on your way out please use the access shaft.
