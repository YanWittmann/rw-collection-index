Oh. I would be very careful with this my friend. The tip of this rebar has had flux condenser coils bonded to it with some ferns and sap. These coils need an impact to release their energy, so it's somewhat safe to handle.
I can't imagine these bits of coil will last long though. It looks like they've been battered with rocks or metal. These coils are from inside of me or Five Pebbles. The rest is the scavengers' natural ingenuity.

This is a hallucinogenic plant. They used to call it a 'Wheel Flower'. It became the symbol for enlightenment as it momentarily enables a creature to let go if its carnal self, and to contact the selves of other planes - dreams, memories, imagined worlds.
Very long ago, they would eat these and stare into the fire.

It is the remains of an overseer.
Overseers act as our eyes on the outside.
I used to have a lot of them, but I lost contact with them when I was neutered. My umbilical is cut. So, since then I am not much more than what you are looking at - a little creature in a box.
I suspect by now all my overseers are gone out there. Without me they would just roam around with no purpose.
The scavengers tend to hunt them, it's one of their very few ways of expressing defiance.
It's of course not completely impossible that there are a few left. Say hello if you see one.

If you must know... this is a low density mass rarefaction cell.
The energy trapped inside this is incredible, and while my facility is capable of extracting it, the shielding on this cell has been damaged. Either through old age, or abuse.
I do not doubt you found this with the scavengers, somehow. While they may not understand the things they find, they have a natural inclination for combat. Using these as a weapon however, would be horribly foolish.

What a fascinating specimen! This is a tightly nested bundle of cellular membranes. However, most of the content within and surrounding the various layers is neither air nor water... it's void fluid!
The cells within this capsule are dividing at extremely rapidly, countering the void fluids simultaneous dissolving of its container.
Somehow it has managed to reach an equilibrium between creation and destruction, but I suspect is is not a very stable system. Any irregular disturbance would likely cause a cascading effect on either end of this spectrum, the result of which would be sudden and destructive.
While I would like to hold onto this for further research, I don't think it would be advisable to have something so volatile sitting around here. Especially given my chamber's open exposure to the elements.
I would recommend you be very careful handling this, old friend!

This is the sensory lobe of a large purposed organism. From within the living systems of an iterator.
Most of the organisms inside us are very simple, only capable of one or two dedicated tasks. This creates the need for for a smaller number of higher organisms used to manage and protect them.
They also facilitate long distance communication within our living systems. And while I do not think you can experience the same sensation, it is quite unpleasant to have one of these destroyed!
I would hope this is not one of mine!

It's the fruit of a feathery plant. The body of it is filled with a sweet sticky goo. I suppose that once the seeds take root, the sac will rot, and this will help feed the young plant where it landed.
It doesn't seem poisonous or hard to open, so it seems the plant's only defense is to float away when disturbed. However, I can only make guesses, as I have never seen these before.

If it were in better condition it might be useful to provide you some protection from the elements. In its current state, however, I don't suppose it has much worth to you.
Unless, perhaps... &lt;little creature&gt;, did you bring this as a gift for me?
Ah!~ In that case, let me just...

There! how does that look? I think it actually fits quite well.

Oh, this is a deeply concerning discovery. Do you have any idea what this is?
These are known as mass rarefaction cells. They are a type of backup energy source that powered our superstructures in times of maintenance, void fluid pipe raptures, and other general power failures.
In the absence of our creators, to replace deteriorating parts, These cells have become one of the major components that allow our facilities to remain powered.
However, the fact that this cell is currently in my hands can only mean bad things for whoever this originally came from. I sure hope you weren't the one responsible for it becoming misplaced!
I know first-hand the tragedy of losing this power. In the wake of my... accident... all of my rarefaction cells were dislodged on impact and washed away in the flood waters.
This cell could be valuable to me, But with my umbilical severed, my overseers running free, and all of my facilities lying deep beneath a large body of water, it would be an impossible task to deliver this to a functional location.
You might be able to find an access shaft into my lower structure nearby, but I have no idea how much is left of it.
Please be careful.
