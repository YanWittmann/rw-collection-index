| If Looks to the Moon likes Slugcat:
|  Hello there! You again!
| If Looks to the Moon dislikes Slugcat:
|  Oh. You.
| Otherwise:
|  Hello there. You again!

|  I have had scavengers come by before. Scavengers! And they left me alive! But... I have told you that already, haven't I?

|  There is nothing here. Not even my memories remain.
|  Even the scavengers that come here from time to time leave with nothing. But... I have told you that already, haven't I?
|  I do enjoy the company though. You're welcome to stay a while, quiet little thing.
