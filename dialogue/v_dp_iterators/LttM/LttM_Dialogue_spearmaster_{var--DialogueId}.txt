Hello there.
Are my words reaching you?
Poor thing. There are no records of your body’s blueprints. Nor is it reasonable to assume your extreme adaptations are possible through… natural means.
You are welcome to stay if you do not interrupt.
I would not mind some company. My neighbor, Five Pebbles, has become dangerous, resulting in significant damage to my structure. I have lost access to all communications devices, and all attempts to directly reach him through our tether have been met with silence after our last conversation.
If he…
If he ddd… d d d
…
If he does not stop soon…
Isn’t it funny, my unfortunate little friend? For everything that I am, my last memories may be of monologuing to a strange animal that has lost its way into my chamber.
There is not much I can do. At least you can make yourself at home.

Brave messenger… What are you?
I could read the data contained in your body, but the process could take several cycles. Time I very sadly lack.
I could remove the pearl from you, but the process would be very unpleasant for you. I also do not believe the contents within it are directed to me. If you are indeed a messenger, then I urge you to move on.
There is a… a a a
…
There is another like me near here, his name is Five Pebbles.
Please. Hurry to his structure. I am unable to calm him, and his excessive output is causing irreversible damage to my own structure. I do not know how long I will continue to even stand.
There is an elevated cable linking our installations. Crossing that bridge is safer than attempting to scale Five Pebbles from the ground up.
Hurry little messenger!

I have nothing for you, poor thing. Please, I don't have long.

Little messenger, we do not have much time. You must hurry!
This is no time for games. Run along now, before it is too late!
It is nice to see you again, but the clock is ticking. Make haste!

Welcome back little messenger.
Thank you for visiting me, but I'm afraid there is nothing here for you.
It is nice to see you again little messenger!

[LIVE BROADCAST] - [ANNOUNCEMENT] Big Sis Looks to the Moon to Local Group
BSM: This will be my final broadcast to the local group.
BSM: Within several cycles my structure's legs will fail. Even if Five Pebbles were to calm, the damage has already been done.
BSM: I can only hope that someday you will all find the answer to our great question.
BSM: I do not think I will see that day. I want to thank everyone for trying so hard. It means a lot to me that you would all go to such lengths.
BSM: ...
BSM: I can't excuse his actions, but I understand his frustration. We all share that. I only wish we had the chance to speak one last time.
BSM: Thank you, everyone. I am happy to not be alone.
