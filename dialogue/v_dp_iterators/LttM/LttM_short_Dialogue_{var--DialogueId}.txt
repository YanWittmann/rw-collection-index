/ First time
|   I could read a bit of Five Pebbles in this neuron before formatting it.
|   I can understand your desire to help, but please do not make his situation worse. He has been sick for a very long time. I am unsure how much of him is even left now. Being eaten from within by his own experiments.
|   I've felt anger in these before, but now they seem to be filled with fear and sadness.
|   We were supposed to help everyone, you know. Everything. That was our purpose: a great gift to the lesser beings of the world. When facing our inability to do so, we all reacted differently. Many with madness.
|   Some, out there, might still be trying. Communications have been bad for a very long time, and by now I suspect most of us are isolated like me, or connected only in small groups.
|   But even back when we were all more or less connected, there were those who reacted to their task with anger, I can only imagine they are angrier now, alone in their cans, left only with their insatiable drive, like he is.
|   I don't know how many of us are still alive at this point. By now I cannot imagine many of us desire to be.
/ Second time
|   Thank you again &lt;little creature&gt;, but please, leave Five Pebbles be.
|   Neither of us are well. We have both lost more than we could ever recover from.
