He... hello
Hello little... creature. You... you did this?
One moment. My memory isn't responding. I... I have no idea...
...must have been gone for...
...
Oh.
Little creature...
You are not well.
I am so sorry to say, but you do not have much time left.
If things are as they seem... thank you.
I don't know why you spent your... last... remaining cycles helping me. But know that I am deeply grateful. I have known very few beings who could aspire to such a noble thing. You really are... an amazing little creature.
I wish I could say I will always remember it.
...
Little friend. Perhaps you already know this, and I don't know what consolation it might bring, but...
You will wake right back up again.
