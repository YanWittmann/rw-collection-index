md-name: LttM Slugcat Naming Convention
MONO
/ The name given to the Slugcat by Looks to the Moon will differ according to various parameters. Each time "&lt;little creature&gt;" is written in the dialogue, it means that other names can appear instead of the default one.
/ A first random value determines which word is used to describe Slugcat (7/10 chance of using something else than "creature"). If it happens, the following words are used:
/  If Looks to the Moon likes Slugcat:
/   If Slugcat has brought more than 5 pearls to Looks to the Moon and Looks to the Moon has more than 3 neurons left:
|    archaeologist
/   Otherwise:
|    friend
/  If Looks to the Moon dislikes Slugcat:
|   tormentor
/ Otherwise:
|  creature
/ If Looks to the Moon has 3 or fewer neurons left, a second random value determines whether she will have trouble speaking or not when saying Slugcat's name (1/2 chance of having trouble). If it happens, she will instead say:
|  Little... creature
/  "Little" can be found capitalized or not.

Oh so you've returned.
Come to take more from me? My memories, my thoughts... just something to fill your stomach?
No... never mind.
It's useless to be angry at an animal following its instincts. Once, a single neuron meant nothing to me...
I see that someone has given you the gift of communication. Must have been Five Pebbles, as you don't look like you can travel very far...
He's sick, you know. Being corrupted from the inside by his own experiments. Maybe they all are by now, who knows. We weren't designed to transcend and it drives us mad.
I'm still angry at you, but it is good to have someone to talk to after all this time. The scavengers aren't exactly good listeners. They do bring me things though, occasionally...

Hello little creature.
What are you? If I had my memories I would know...
Perhaps... I saw you before?
You must be very brave to have made it all the way here. But I'm sorry to say your journey here is in vain.
As you can see, I have nothing for you. Not even my memories.
Or did I say that already?
