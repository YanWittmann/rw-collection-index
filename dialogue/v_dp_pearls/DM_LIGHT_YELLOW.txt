Oh! This is one of my pearls. Did you extract this from my Memory Conflux?
While I value your curiosity, I would prefer that you don't move things around or steal items from this facility. I try to keep everything as organized as possible, so that I don't forget. I value my data and memories quite a lot, it would be a tragedy to lose them!
As for the contents of this pearl... it's a large batch of my personal notes and research. I don't have the time to go over all of this with you, nor do I think you would gain much from it.
Could you please just put this pearl back where you found it?
