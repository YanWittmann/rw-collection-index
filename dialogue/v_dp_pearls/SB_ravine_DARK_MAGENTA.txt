It's a conversation log, all plain text. You want me to read it?
"1681.662 - PRIVATE\nSeven Red Suns, Chasing Wind
CW: Have you had any contact with Five Pebbles recently?
SRS: Not in a long while actually! Unless worrying about him counts.
CW: One of his neighbors, Unparalleled Innocence, sent an overseer to his can and got some images. They were made public in the local group, in an effort to be mean I suppose. There's no other way of putting it - he looks awful.
SRS: Tell me.
CW: He's got the rot, very badly. Big cysts have become mobile and are scattering down the west and middle legs. He does listen to you, and few others by now, so you should talk to him.
SRS: I will try to contact him. Does Moon know?
CW: Moon has been unavailable for some time."

On the left side of the chasm.

=== hint: Strategy
After exiting the gate from Farm Array, climb up to the first or second platform that is a little higher up.
Pounce from there to the left and drop down a few screens to find it.
If you fail, you can use the abundant amount of speers on the left side and in the tunnel after that to climb back up.
