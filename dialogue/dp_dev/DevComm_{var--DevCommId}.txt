Norgad: When we needed a subregion to connect CC and DS, I knew exactly the theme I wanted to go for.\nI was inspired by going on walks as a kid and seeing large puddles of stagnant water by the trails.\nThe water had this intense orange color to it, but was so incredibly still.
Norgad: I wanted a subregion that was basically a giant collection system for all the gunk that must build up in Cc\nThe water goes through sump after sump and filter after filter as it's gradually clarified on its way down.
Norgad: I never ended up making any actual levels for the area, but I did make a schematic, with the general flow and shapes of rooms.

Will: Shaded was mostly crushed by Five Pebble's collapse, but unlike Moon, it's not clear if all of him fell down.
Will: His rotten interior likely made him fall in pieces, which is why this place is not as destroyed\nas Waterfront was when Moon fell. Of course, that means Five Pebbles is in a much worse state.

md-var-DevCommId: Finding_Moon
md-name: Finding Moon
Will: This small collection of rooms act as the heart of Moon's layout, as it borders all four subregions.
Will: Imagine Moon's structure as four areas. The upper region, with her topside, chamber, and memory conflux. Two middle regions,\none focused around zappers, and the other more on fluxing gravity. Finally, the bottom region containing her leg and underhang.
Will: When players move through these areas, they are unlikely to backtrack to the underhang area, as they are\nlikely to feel as if that area will not lead them to progress. This leaves them between the two middle areas.
Will: If they travel up from this room, they will find Moon's outer chamber, with no access to Moon\nherself. However, they are close to the familiar Shoreline rooms, and may attempt to reach Moon that way.
Will: If the player explores the left side of Moon, they will find the Precipice gate before moon tells them. However,\nthis gate is much less expensive to leave then enter, and staying inside Moon is more likely the intended path.\nThis will lead them to exploring the right hand region, or reaching the crossover tunnel at the top of the left region.
Will: In both cases these will eventually connect them to the familiar sights of a memory conflux subregion! From\nthere all the players need is a hint towards her chamber by the use of GSB musical themes similar to Five Pebbles!
Will: Even with all these hints and attempts to guide players without saying anything, getting lost is inevitable, but that's part of the fun!

md-var-DevCommId: Mod_Ideas
md-name: Mod Ideas
Andrew: I start to wonder if on release, people are going to think MSC stole a lot of ideas from other modders.
Andrew: There have been many mods released over the course of MSc\ndevelopment that share big commonalities with features that MSC contains.
Andrew: Electric Spear, Crafting, MoodMod, Forecast, RW Drought... to name just a few.
Andrew: These are all actually coincidential, and I have plenty of old development\nvideos to show those features implemented in MSC before any of those mods existed.
Andrew: And likewise those mods couldn't have been inspired by MSC, since most of\nthese features were never teased by us, being held in secret behind closed doors.
Andrew: It's really just a case of "great minds think alike", I guess!
Andrew: There are a few instances where we did use things from other mods, though, so I'd like to give those credit.
Andrew: The ability to choose custom colors for your slugcats was inspired by Colorfoot.
Andrew: Our Dev Tools incorporates LeeMoriya's Warp Menu mod, which was very nifty in the later parts of development!
Andrew: Also thanks to Topicular for providing me the assets to replicate\ntheir SoonTM mod in MSC, and get the 1.8 ending cutscenes in here!
Andrew: As for slugpups, the first person to ever attempt an implementation of them was Topicular.\nSecond came Screams, at which point I quickly got in contact with him to help implement pups into MSC.
Andrew: Lastly, RatRat made the third attempt at slugpups, and was\nthe first to bless the community with a playable version. Nice job!
Andrew: Oh, and I guess this is probably common knowledge by now, but the original\nSpearmaster in the first MSC version was inspired by the old Grapecat mod!

Andrew: This same pearl is in this same room in Rivulet's Submerged Superstructure, too.\nAlthough, Past Moon and Future Moon have different dialog if you deliver the pearl to them.
Andrew: Actually, there's quite a few pearls where this is the case.
Andrew: Depending on timeline location, the dialog wouldn't always make sense, so we\nhave some different variations of the pearl readings for different points in time.
Andrew: Did you discover that you can deliver pearls to Pebbles too, during\nArtificer's campaign? He has different things to say for every pearl compared to Moon.
Andrew: I don't expect the player to see all these different possible variations, as pearl\ndelivery is far too time consuming and tedious. I imagine it'll be more of a community effort.
Andrew: Though, with all of these timeline differences, I wish good luck to the people\nwho eventually try to organize all of this information on the More Slugcats wiki...

Will: Originally, Moon's leg was simply going to be standing in Shoreline. However, Artificer's\ndrowning mechanics combined with Shoreline became a constant issue. One we eventually\ndecided to remove entirely by creating a unique region to replace Shoreline in the past.
Will: This solved several problems at once. Artificer no longer hit a brick wall in shoreline.\nWe could have a more grand scavenger population roam Waterfront, and finally we could\ncreate a unique area that presented a progression in the timeline between slugcats.
Will: All while also giving Moon a proper place to stand that did not feel like she was simply dropped\nonto an existing region! And, still maintaining familiar elements and routes, with some interesting twists.

Will: The final introduction of mother spiders, and small swarms of tiny spiders would solidify the design of the\narea. Creating a more peaceful leg climb, with small bursts of combat from miros vultures, and orange lizards.

Will: Back on the proper topic; The major way we wanted to show her older design, was to include more obvious "back room" connections.
Will: Five Pebble's structure is fancy and new, with all the nastier parts of his internals hidden away deep in the walls.

Will: Originally, you would pass through an always open region gate on your way to Moon.\nThis gate would later act as the return path for Rivulet after activating Moon's heart.
Will: However, having a gate in the middle of Moon's GSB, made no sense at all. Eventually, we added\nMoon's city as a sub region, and moved that fake gate to act as her Underhang's always open gate.
Will: I'm kinda glad we moved an actual gate up here, even if Spearmaster is unable to use it.

Andrew: Why did I create a creature as horrifying as the Miros Vultures?
Andrew: They were actually created way back in the early ages of the Rain World\nmodding community, even predating the very first version of the MSC mod.
Andrew: Back in those days we were simply interested if we even could create\na custom creature, so I paid no consideration as to whether I should.
Andrew: To start with something easy-ish, I decided to use an existing creature's code as a base, and just combine\ntogether bits and pieces from elsewhere to make some horrifying chimera. Both in function and in implementation.
Andrew: Since I had them functioning and available already, I decided to just\ntoss them into MSC as well. Because why not? What's the worst that can happen?
Andrew: Lore-wise, I see Miros Vultures as creatures that thrive only in dark areas\nand cold areas. Though between the two, their preference is cold over dark.
Andrew: They make their first appearance early in the timeline, thriving\nin the dark regions underneath Pebbles' and Moon's superstructures.
Andrew: Once Moon collapsed, they abandoned the dark areas of Pebbles structure for\nthe more favorable blizzard-like environments that began to form at Bitter Aerie.
Andrew: Then by Saint's time, they had all the opportunity to spread themselves out across\nthe snowy landscape, and become a horrifying threat that plagued the entire land.

md-var-DevCommId: Defining_Moon's_Region
md-name: Defining Moon's Region
Will: This small set of rooms between Luna and Moon's chamber represent a very complex\nissue. Because these rooms are present in multiple parts of the timeline, they must remain\nconsistent! However, Rain World's region based structure requires gates to connect regions.
Will: Placing gates without any thought can make players confused, as Five\nPebbles' structure has already defined several locations where gates are likely\nto be... and inserting a gate in established rooms wouldn't be right either!
Will: So, we became tasked with creating a region structure that made sense between Shoreline and Moon before her collapse.
Will: Our solution in the end was to combine Moon's interior and exterior into one region. Like\nher wall in Shoreline, Moon has many more leaks into the outside world from inside her structure.\nThis also reflects in her Wall's design, featuring many open pipes draining from her systems.
Will: Unfortunately, we also had one last problem to solve, creating an imposing and moody entrance to her collapsed structure's underside.
Will: We replaced what would be her CC wall gate,with a connection hallway into her structure, like the kind seen in Five Pebble's Underhang.
Will: I like to hope these compromises made Moon enjoyable to discover on all points of the timeline!

Will: We wanted to change the region up, without destroying the personality that the\nrough edges give it. Would it still be Drainage System if we removed all the drowning?
Will: Aside from the fluxing water we added for Artificer, we added some more poles and paths. A way to return to\nthe upper levels of the region, and at the same time making the drowning tunnel a sort of "fast travel" for the region.
Will: Our changes to swimming also cut down on drowning related incidents, without entirely removing the danger of the tunnel.

md-name: Drowning Rework
Will: This room brings back some particularly fond memories from playing 1.0 back in the day.
Will: I nearly gave up the game entirely after wandering into Drainage System, and making it\nall the way to the gate. Only to save before the gate, die in Filter, and be stuck on the side\nof Drainage, with only the tunnel swim for escape. I'm happy I didn't give up back then!
Will: It did lead to a very large desire to tweak swimming to be less frustrating, but that is an extremely sensitive mechanic!
Will: If we extend breath timing, we could mess with the feeling of dread that comes from long swims.\nHowever, there is clearly some element of swimming that felt unfair, especially for early players.
Will: The only major change we made to swimming is the rate of upwards swimming slugcat will attempt while\ndrowning. The original game applies this force linearly, often trapping you against the ceiling very quickly.
Will: MSC applies this force exponentially, giving you a longer period of control, but with the same amount of time until you drown.
Will: This allows players to make those final course corrections that might save their lives, but without ruining the drowning time's balance.

Will: The small area of rooms on each side of this gate are meant to act like a frustrating barrier to players.
Will: Slugcats with standard mobility will find themselves blocked by tight jumps, ugly ledges,\nand a high karma gate once they reach the top. Along with an awkward to use shelter.
Will: Players coming from shaded will need to use wall spears, and navigate around miros birds, or cross a crumbling bridge in the dark.
Will: While none of these paths are brutally hard or unforgiving, they are at least irritating\nand unwelcoming to inexperienced players. The point of this is to create a segment where slugcats\nwith enhanced mobility can shine. In particular, Artificer's explosive jump mechanics.
Will: Players passing through this room from the start of the campaign will be blocked from using\nthe flooded path, and be forced to make jumps that only Artificer can. As well, the high karma\ngate presented at the start of their campaign is easily overcome by their karma mechanics.
Will: Sometimes the best choice in design is to create an unwelcoming situation for a player. To which they\ncan succeed, but the cost of doing is either experience, or to return with the tools required to do it easier.

Will: Regional difficulty is easily the most complex and varied topic in Rain World design, or even game design as a whole.
Will: The intended route for your game's regions may be completely subverted by your players.\nThey may even regard something you designed as the more difficult path forwards, as the easiest.\nOften because of factors you cannot easily control, as well as individual variations in player skill.
Will: Players more acclimated to swimming may find Drainage System trivial, while others may find it infuriating, and refuse to enter it entirely!
Will: Providing alternative routes that explore different player skills was important when we chose to connect certain regions, or make new ones.
Will: This set of rooms under Industrial has always acted like a hub for the various paths to Shoreline.
Will: Garbage Wastes is the most direct, but the Scavenger presence might be frustrating for plays with poor luck, or experiences around them.
Will: Shaded is ahead, but many new players struggle in the region's darkness.
Will: Finally our own addition, Pipeyard, offers a difficult enemy laden path, before the player is given the choice of darkness or water.
Will: The water path follows a Drainage System like swimming challenge, at half the size. While\nthe darkness path gives access to Filtration System, and links up near to where Drainage System\ndoes. This offers a safer path into Subterranean without a rough swim through Drainage itself.

Will: Scavenger kill squads in the base game have an insane advantage over the player. They know your room, general location, and\nwill follow you from region to region, for as long as the scavengers are angry enough at the player. They are absolutely relentless!
Will: Of course this relentless nature made several rooms incredibly dangerous to even enter, this is one of them. As by the time the gate\nhas finished opening, scavengers are already pouring from the nearby den, and into this room. All of them armed, and on the high ground.
Will: In most cases the player could do nothing. As soon as they entered the gate, they had brought the scav-ageddon upon themselves!
Will: Of course, removing this relentless nature was somewhat out of the question, we use this as the primary difficulty of Artificer's campaign.\nInstead we added a delay, a large one upon the region's loading, and smaller "reload" delays, between each kill squad's dispatch.
Will: This can be imagined as news of the player's movements and actions being passed from region to region. Scavenger's squad management\nrequiring time to prepare, and to locate exactly where they should organize to cut the player off. Instead of psychically knowing exactly what to do.
Will: Another reason we added this was for LC, as the entire 50 scavenger population of the region was once killed\nby Ender in a single room. As soon as one kill squad was destroyed, another was sent to challenge the player.
Will: It was pretty incredible, the corpses lagged the room!

md-var-DevCommId: Fourth_Background_Layer
md-name: Fourth Background Layer
Will: Slime_Cubed's fourth layer mod was added late into development.\nOriginally, the fourth layer was something cut from Rain World's base game.
Will: It was later restored with this mod, but lacked content to make use of\nit. If we were going to add this mod, we should at least present its use!
Will: As such, every region with enough background space for a presentable\nfourth layer was given its own unique background screens to use.
Will: Most of these new layers are uniquely made rooms being projected\nbehind the normal room layers, but some are unique art made in other ways.
Will: Regardless, I'd call our showcase of MSC's built-in forth layer support,\nto at least be somewhat of a success! Most of the rooms I did were based off\nof the old alpha version! Or contain specific references to features from it.

Screams: Now, even carrying a single pup on your head is a big exercise in restraint. You can't\njust spam the throw button when threatened, or you'll toss your pup right into the battlefield.

Slugitar: Just seeing some of the rooms I’ve made and also the new as well as the remixed rooms in this new coat of\npaint truly shines a new light on what the original concept was, which was kept perfectly after all this time.
Slugitar: I can remember the chats the team had deciding what would be best for this area as it really didn’t seem\nlike it would physically fit between the void sea, so having it a karma Jedi mind trip works extremely well.

Andrew: Without having too clear of a goal of the gameplay implications, and also mainly feeling it would be\nexcessive for a region that already had a lot of other stuff going on, we eventually decided to scrap it.
Andrew: I'm really sad we had to drop it, because the visuals for it were pretty much already fully implemented by Ongomato by that point.
Andrew: First you would see a huge sky-scraper sized tidal wave of dust in the far background rush over the city in the distance.
Andrew: Shortly afterwards a big cloud of dust would topple down upon the foreground. This cloud respected\nthe level geometry and would gradually flood-fill its way through the map until every crevace was covered.

Will: The AI of the Farm Array deer has been modified considerably from the base game.
Will: At first we only added an option for turning the deer, and stopping their current path, but this ran into more problems.
Will: We ultimately HAD to reconstruct the deer AI entirely, and correct an entire list of small issues and potential mistakes.
Will: One example is that deer were incapable of getting unstuck because their bodies are locked\nin place at the end of a path. As well, deer entering a room would begin resting before they wandered.
Will: This meant that deer would enter a screen, stop, rest, and run out of room time. Leaving the room before they did anything.
Will: Deer also moved in the direction their body faced while entering the room. Due to\ntheir rest location they would turn around while entering. Often this leads to them leaving\nthe room, but sometimes they would just vibrate against the room border the whole cycle.
Will: This doesn't even begin to describe the deer-on-deer interaction and priority\nissues that Joar addressed in the 1.5 update. Hopefully, we have finally tamed these\nterrible beasts, while not removing the durpy behavior that made them special.

Andrew: Some people have asked why Moon has a siren but Pebbles does not.
Andrew: Maybe the siren was used to alert those on the surface of the coming rain. This would have been especially important\nwhile she was still in the middle of construction and the city on top was not yet fully built and ready for inhabitation.
Andrew: Pebbles is a much newer model of Iterator than Moon, and by the time he was built, the surface was already abandoned.

md-name: Rework of Moon's Exterior
Will: Moon's exterior rooms went through a considerable rework midway through development.
Will: The original exterior of Moon was part of Waterfront Complex, and\nincluded all of her leg, and up to the gate that is still used on her wall.
Will: Originally, the players would climb her leg, enter to the her wall, and enter Moon from\nthe side. While this worked, it created a complex overlap of region themes that felt unfitting.
Will: The original Precipice only included the scaffolding between Moon and Pebbles as well,\nand the upper area felt completely disconnected, just as badly as Moon's leg in Waterfront.
Will: To fix this, we moved all of Moon's structure, exterior and all, inside of its own region, while\nalso expanding Waterfront's upper areas to include giant towers that were destroyed by Moon's collapse.
Will: This allowed us to link the lower region, with the upper Precipice,\nand also gave players more options to path in and out of Moon's structure.

Will: These areas were so isolated and alien that simply placing fruit or mold didn't fit. As well, these areas\nwere also dark. Rivulet needing to explore in complete darkness while drowning didn't seem like a fun idea.
Will: The solution to these problems was to make a balanced mix of an answer to all of them at once!
Will: We created a new unique food that was also a light source. We then allowed Rivulet\nto eat food underwater to avoid player irritation. Finally, we made each glowweed provide\nhalf a pip of food, so we could place excessive amounts to light a room.
Will: Two bonus upsides are that jetfish will compete with the player to collect them, and the\ngreen glow of the plants also defined a bio-luminescent lit cave theme that defined lower MS!

Andrew: Why is it snowing up here? Partially the same reason why there's snow at the peaks of mountains.
Andrew: In MSC's version of the Rain World, the natural state of this world is a cold, frigid one.
Andrew: However, certain parts of iterator's superstructures, and their surrounding\nfacilities give off a substantial amount of heat as a byproduct of their functions.
Andrew: They're like giant space heaters... and collectively they might even increase the global temperature\nof the world... at the very least, they provide significant heat within their local operational region.
Andrew: For Moon, her machinery has stagnated, and the westward blowing winds\ncarries most of the heat from Pebbles' machinery in the opposite direction of her.
Andrew: Between the altitude and the far proximity to any functional radiated heat, it has begun to get quite cold here.

md-name: Monolith of Moon
Will: Moon's collapsed structure is both the largest and most complex region in the game.\nWorking off a modified version of her original map, we went into this quite unprepared!
Will: This region went through a few reworks, but the route to and location of her heart has remained the same through all of them.
Will: The arteries act as a fast travel system for Rivulet; any entrance into them will inevitably lead Riv to the heart.
Will: Without many other goals, large chunks of this region are purely cosmetic, and acts as exploration\nfiller. However, sometimes not cutting the fat of a region has more benefits then it appears!
Will: As the simple story route goal for Rivulet is hidden inside a region that is made to show the progression of time,\nplayers will likely have very different feelings, based on if they played Rivulet before Spearmaster, or vice versa!
Will: Familiar places and routes through the structure are intact, but the destruction re-contextualizes them.
Will: The secret little gem of this design direction, is the realization that Spearmaster and Rivulet's unlock are in the same location.

Andrew: Actually, there's quite a few pearls where this is the case.
Andrew: Depending on timeline location, the dialog wouldn't always make sense, so we\nhave some different variations of the pearl readings for different points in time.
Andrew: Did you discover that you can deliver pearls to Pebbles too, during\nArtificer's campaign? He has different things to say for every pearl compared to Moon.
Andrew: I don't expect the player to see all these different possible variations, as pearl\ndelivery is far too time consuming and tedious. I imagine it'll be more of a community effort.

Andrew: Some of the teasers we gave out during development were red herrings.
Andrew: Some unintentional, because we teased stuff that later got scrapped, or reworked, or drastically changed.
Andrew: Others intentional, to make sure the hardcore detectives in the community were led off\ntrack and didn't piece together the entire storyline and timeline before the mod was released.
Andrew: Others also to try to control the level of hype to make sure it didn't get too overblown, and kept at a "simmering" level.
Andrew: I see a big mistake a lot of developers tend to make is to show the\nbest-of-the-best that their game has to offer in their teasers and trailers.
Andrew: Which always leads to people getting dissapointed on release, when\nthe majority of the game is not at the level that the teasers were.
Andrew: One of my favorite instances of this is the Rivulet snow teaser.
Andrew: I wanted to subtly hint at the existance of snow, but without\nrevealing the amazing blizzard effects we had actually managed to make.
Andrew: So I tried to make the snow effects in that teaser look as underwhelming and shitty as possible.
Andrew: The snow breath effects were this ugly oversized grey cloud of smoke that looked like Rivulet was about to catch on fire.
Andrew: And then later we show another Rivulet teaser with one measly little puddle of snow on the ground. Amazing.

Will: We knew from the start that Rivulet's campaign was going to feature a large underwater area beneath Moon.
Will: However, much of Rain World's creatures wouldn't work in this unique\nenvironment. Having only jetfish, and leviathans to avoid felt underwhelming!
Will: This is what lead up toward adopting Pipster's aquapede design, and creating the giant jellyfish.
Will: Underwater combat was already difficult, as spears are nearly useless. So new underwater\nthreats needed to be visible from far away, or are a slow and drawn out grab that leads to death.
Will: The aquacenti's light, and the swaying arms of the giant jellyfish fill both of these roles.
Will: Originally, we designed the jellyfish as clams with three long arms that pretend to be glowweeds!
Will: However, this version of the creature never made it far, as using them anywhere else felt forced.
Will: Giant jellyfish are not an amazing creature either, as their purely static nature caused difficulties with arena mode.

Andrew: Originally when OE was going to have NPC slugcats and slugpups regularly roaming\nabout the region, there was going to be a tie-in with Artificer's void sea ending.
Andrew: There would be a lot of void spawn floating around the deeper parts of the region,\nsimilar to Shaded Citadel, with void spawn bubbles also situated throughout the area.
Andrew: If you came there with Gourmand after completing Artificer's void sea ending, you could find a crimson colored void spawn bubble.
Andrew: Popping the bubble would release the void spawn, which could then be\nspotted throughout the region later, following the various slugpups around.
Andrew: That all got thrown out when we scaled back our ideas for NPC slugcats, however.

Andrew: When Gourmand came back with tales of the large variety of food sources he found beyond\nthe bounds of their current territory, the slugcats began to prepare for a big migration.
Andrew: Survivor and Monk's intro takes place during this migration, and they\nget separated from their family while travelling away from their old home.
Andrew: It's also why going back to the tree later on in the timeline, you find it abandoned.
Andrew: Maybe some of the pups you find during Survivor's campaign were\nalso poor children who got separated and left behind during that process.

Will: We only intended to have one of them, but it eventually became clear that OE was\nmuch too shelter sparse. So, with the ability to attach multiple doors to a single ancient\nshelter, we used this problem as a chance to flex the creativity this shelter type offered!

Will: The warbling confused sounding noise heard in the OE threat music at night is the only layer that was made for this mushroom effect.
Will: We never got around to making layers for all the other regions that have threat tracks, so the feature was canceled.

Will: It seems a bit backward to think that expanding Filtration System could\nmake it easier, but the large reduction in lizard-clogs would help any region.
Will: Due to the original room layout of Filtration System, the lizards would often become stuck in the tunnel toward the Depths.
Will: We chose to insert several new rooms. At first just to solve the lizard clog\nitself, but later these rooms would be expanded by a connection to Pipeyard.
Will: We had to increase the creature density to compensate, but Filter is certainly not any less difficult to explore in the dark.
Will: I wonder how many players will stumble on their Filtration System knowledge, when they trip into one of the new rooms by mistake!

Will: During development we were unsure how to return the player to the area above Moon. We were not sure if we\nwanted to create Moon's city either, as Pebbles' city was already very expansive, and warranted its own region.
Will: Not many options were viable however, as most of them would place region gates in bizarre locations, such as Memory Conflux.
Will: We were kinda forced to add Moon's city as a one way gate with no Artificer-style drone to access it.
Andrew: Which by the way, if you hack Artificer here, the gate still won't open...\nbecause Moon's city requires a different citizens id than Pebbles' city!
Will: It's funny to look at the old maps where there is a gate between Moon's chamber and the rest of her structure. At\nleast the option we chose, of no shrine gate and having the city gate be inside Moon's shrine, made a lot more sense.
Will: Even Five Pebble's city gate is a bit more awkward then Moon's, needing to connect to the outer rim of his wall!
Will: The main reason we wanted the path above Moon, was to have Rivulet use the top door of Moon's chamber as\na cutscene trigger for their ending, or at least as a, "oh hello there, I wasn't expecting that!" Easter egg.
Will: I'm glad we decided to add the sub-region, but it does make MS itself pretty bloated with all it has to offer...
Will: If we had the option now, I would have split it off into its own region, but hindsight is 2020,\nand making it big enough to be its own region is too much of an investment this late in the mod.

Will: However, its abuse was pretty apparent. From scavengers fighting it\nin LC, to what we had planned for Rivulet, and even on Spearmaster...
Will: We decided to take the healthiest option, and avoid its abuse entirely. With one\nexception, any reasonable ideas for corruption had to properly fit within Rivulet's Five\nPebbles. The corruption's ideas were to be contained inside The Rot as a region on its own.
Will: To abuse the corruption beyond that could lead to too many weak plot\nscenarios, where adding corruption would be a cheap and easy answer.

Will: Writing for Five Pebbles was very difficult! It's hard to write both a smug, and angst-feeling character like him.
Will: A lot of players seem to view him as simply a villain for what happened\nbetween him and Moon, or even mistake the rot as an intentional creation.
Will: The story itself in the base game is deeper then that, and Moon would never have\nreason to treat him so closely if Five Pebbles was simply a jerk all along. She was a\nbig sister to him, and he did have his own relationship with Seven Red Suns.
Will: I think we settled on the idea of a mix of helplessness, from something that is physically impossible\nfor slugcat to comprehend. His "god like" identity seems to be posturing, rather then just bragging.
Will: Under that confidence he is still a dying machine. Eaten from the inside out.
Will: His slow transition from anger to helplessness was based off one of Moon's neuron conversations.
Will: Focusing Spearmaster as a sort of betrayal of trust, that SRS understood his goals, but\nthen to have the same friend return to them with the worry they might mess up. Only for Moon\nto have caused that situation, and not himself, or at least in his isolated point of view!
Will: We noticed his anger slowly subside by Hunter, even giving Moon his regards as he sends the player off.
Will: Because of that Artificer would serve as a transition period of those two\nstates, and would give us the most interaction out of all the other slugcats.

Will: Writing for an established character is something incredibly difficult.\nEspecially one with little screen time, but with such a big impression.
Will: Straying too far in any direction can instantly create the sensation\nof "fan fiction," where a character suddenly acts only to further a plot.
Will: Avoiding that is hard; one of the ways we tried to do so at first\nwas to only follow what was laid out in neuron and pearl conversations.
Will: This fell apart as we reached Artificer as we had the chance to do\nsomething unique with the character that was not possible to do before.
Will: We had the chance for the player to interact with Five Pebbles at their\nown pace. Instead of being rushed out of his room at the threat of death. As due\nto the drone, he is unable to simply kill them without a justified reason.
Will: Things kind of took on a life of their own. Initially his pearl dialog had more spite, and dislike of the player to them.
Will: However, on specific topics it became interesting to get his insights on certain events, and some of his own pearls.
Will: This created the idea that he might be a little bit of a history buff, or archivist,\nexcited to see when the player brings them something not yet documented.

Will: The addition of the endless spear mechanics came later, based on Minkimaro's\nconcept art of Spearmaster pulling needles out a hole on their back.
Will: These ideas became the Spearmaster that made it to release, but we actually had two other ideas!
Will: One idea was to give Spearmaster their own separate game mode, with a single large region to explore.
Will: The other was the Judge, a Saint-like slugcat who would have guardian-like powers, and\nthrow spears at extremely high speeds. Trapped in a world completely corrupted by the rot.

md-name: Day / Night Cycle
Andrew: The day / night cycle was actually one of the very first things to be implemented\ninto More Slugcats Expansion, along with water fluxing, passive rainfall, and lethal water.
Andrew: Getting it to work properly with the Wall came much later, however, as the background\nelements (such as the city view and distant iterators) don't change color with the palette.
Andrew: Changing the colors of those requires editing their shaders, which was beyond the scope of anyone's knowledge at that time.\nIt took at least another year or so before the modding community figured out how to mod, edit, and add new shaders into the game.
Andrew: I'm really happy we added this though... the sunset transition is really beautiful, and it gives a\nlot of extra charm and character to these areas of the world that aren't under the threat of the rainfall.
Andrew: Nighttime becomes a new threat as well, as all of the daytime creatures go to sleep, while a new set of creature spawns for night come out.
Andrew: Metropolis is especially dangerous at night, as all of the elite guards come out to patrol. But this can also be a\nreward for a skilled player who managed to survive that long, as you can snatch some really deadly weaponry from them!

Dakras: The Judge was also a thing before we decided upon Spearmaster. Most that got\ndone was ideas, and me poorly making 5P dark and throwing proto-DLLS everywhere.
Dakras: ...Trust me when I say it's for the best that we brought back spearmaster as early as we did.

Andrew: It was fun to have gotten to get into the Rain World modding scene all the way from the very start.
Andrew: And watch how everything rapidly progressed over these few short years.
Andrew: From the very first person managing to toggle on the game's internal dev tools mode.
Andrew: And everyone having their minds blown (myself included), that the game could even be modded AT ALL.
Andrew: For a game that was never really intended or designed to be moddable...
Andrew: Who would have thought we'd come far enough to create an expansion like this!
Andrew: Big thanks to Videocult for giving us access to their level editor. That was a huge game changer.
Andrew: I know Videocult was skeptical that we'd even manage to figure out how to use the cursed thing...
Andrew: But I think we've done pretty well for ourselves.

Norgad: This was the final region artwork I worked on. I'm really happy with how it turned out, it's really bright and hopeful!
Norgad: The pipes took forever though... Miracle my wrist is still attached.
Norgad: ...
Norgad: The region actually reused an old region's internal name (VS). That region\nwas joined with another I believe, and we just decided to reuse the initials.
Norgad: R.I.P. Void System.
Will: Unfortunately, VS wasn't anything amazing, it was just Sub with the depths ripped off it. Before\nwe had the conditional link system, we had to duplicate entire regions to change room connections.

md-var-DevCommId: Routing_Options
md-name: Routing Options
Will: Pipeyard was created pretty quickly, and was mostly the result of a lack of restraint on my part.
Will: I wanted to redo the Root in some way that would work well with MSC, but nothing quite worked.\nThe big concern was that the Root's path from the exterior to sub wouldn't work well for late game.
Will: After a lot of rethinking, I decided to make the area about giving Sky Islands more routing options.
Will: In the base game it acts only as a difficult path between farm and CC, but now\nit offers a third path. One that allows access to sub, industrial, and shoreline.
Will: However, the sub and shoreline paths are a bit nasty to take.
Will: The shoreline path itself was very fun to make, invoking the same feelings\nthat made me question Rain World's design back when I first played it!
Will: Being trapped at the far end of a painful underground swim, but making the end of that segment worth it felt right to me.

md-var-DevCommId: Region_Creatures_Timeline
md-name: Region Creatures Timeline
Andrew: There was actually a ton of thought that went into the creatures that spawn in each region, at each spot on the timeline.
Andrew: Will had actually put together an entire illustrated timeline chart for every creature\nin the game, showing their presence, evolution, and extinction events across the game's history.
Andrew: As well as another long document explaining the origins, food chains, migration\npatterns, preferences, and other attributes of each creature's species over time.
Andrew: All of these considerations were factored into which creatures to include and exclude in each region for each character.
Andrew: Will also wrote a region creature density analyzing script, which he used to balance out creature spawns in each\nregion to keep difficulty levels consistent, and creature densities appropriate based on the global population decay.

Screams: Wanna hear a funny thought?
Screams: Imagine being someone who discovered Paincat before ever seeing pups in the regular game.
Screams: I'm glad the slugpup limit is 2 by default, because the game gets exponentially harder when you add more than that.
Screams: With this in mind, I suggested removing Paincat's pup limit and giving it a\n100% spawn rate in all regions. Will proceeded to add on to this with, and I quote...
Will: "all paincat slugpups spawn as white with red faces"
Will: "and when they die they spawn an activated singularity egg"
Screams: "How do you tell them apart?" I asked.
Will: "You don't."
Andrew: And then I implemented them as level editor gremlins instead...
Dakras: They didn't even have the heart to tell me what they did to my poor, poor slugcat.
