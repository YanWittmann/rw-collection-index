You have no name.
I once had! I was embalmed, adorned, readied for the journey.
So proud. There was jubilation! My name was sung, loud and clear.
Did they know? That I didn't quite leave, didn't quite stay?
Should I be ashamed? That I linger here, where my memories are kept?
Should I be ashamed that I now envy your flesh prison?

From my perch, I've overlooked this land for an eternity.
Watched as this vast expanse was blanketed into an endless tundra.
We remain trapped in place, and yet can never stop moving.
Funneled endlessly into an unknown future...
To what destination do these memories reach?

Behold this empty husk of a land...
Populated only by storms, ruins and abominations. It wasn't always thus.
I was once the Count of 2 living blocks, esteemed by my peers. I had progeny!
From within my vessel of flesh, I would perch upon this spot to observe the rising of the sun.
Corporeal matters seem so distant now. Most have forgotten this place, but I remain.
Perhaps I reminisce because I cannot go. Perhaps I cannot go because memory traps me here.

Our presence has been revealed to you now, young one.
The attunement has become... much nearer.
Like a ripple distorted upon a moonlit reflection.
Repetitous, seemingly endless strife.
An unimaginable curse.
Swim with the tide or against it.

We can feel your presence, little creature.
Your attunement has become... much closer to ours.
The mark you received is an unimaginable gift.
The struggle, the cycles...
It can all fade, like a morning mist beneath the glory of the sun.
We found a way.

Another presence attempts to commune with mine.
Have I perceived your voice before? I have existed long enough to overhear them all.
Those who have been, and those who have yet to be.
Each serving as a wave propagating throughout the annals of history.
Listened as I have for many eons, 'tis true, some of those swells cannot help but mirror back.

Do you hear it, little one?
The buzzing in the air?
The endless chatter of a thousand thousand voices, long dead?
They are gone, and yet they speak. Neither here nor there.
Does that seem familiar? Yes, it is quite amusing for a being in my predicament!

Why is it?
This long forgotten place beckons me, drawn by a certain presence...
The fields here are not as I remember. Too much has changed.
But, by forfeiting familiarities, perhaps something new is gained?
Despite all, this site still has not revealed the entirety of its secrets.
Perhaps that is the reason for my continued imprisonment.

Strange...
Something still draws me here. Even after all this time.
The weather is so different now, but the fields...
I do not need eyes to know that the grasses still sway gently in the winds.
To have grasped at the boundless infinites of the cosmic void...
Yet here I am contemplating these same fields as I once did, talking to some sort of rodent.

A little beast!
Come to join me in this great undoing.
The old world will soon vanish, wiped from history, to pave a path for the dawning of a new era.
How many have been consumed so far? Were we the tenth civilization, or the thousandth?
Amusingly, they thought their small struggles bore such great significance.
All was naught but to serve the void.

A little beast!
But not as dim as the rest, perhaps?
So down into the depths you go as many others before you, drawn to the void again and again, an endless drip drip drip.
Much like these tunnels and caves that amuse me so. The bones of forgotten civilizations, heaped like so many sticks.
Did they dig too deep, or not deep enough?
Fools. We were right to drill straight through them!

Such drive! Such tenacity! All to come to such a lonely forsaken place!
Was it all to find me, young one, or did the idea of such a journey itself spark the fire within you?
Such enthusiasm should be rewarded! What an amazing little beast you are!

Do you see the same as me?
Beauty continuing to bloom even in a place long forgotten.
I did not have the will to depart, nor the desire.
Why did they always search for an escape, as if we were imprisoned?
What offering from the void could usurp the gift of life already given?
This moment, right here! It is where we are meant to be.

You stand upon our creation.
I toiled away until my final breath. As did many of us, through countless generations.
Research, shipments, architecture, computation, politics, worship, revolutions!
All for a heap of rusted metal steeped in a puddle of frozen water.
I placed my faith into the hands of random gods.
Now I must endure it to the end.

What brings you to this lonely place?
Do you seek the same isolation that I once did in flesh?
An angry fool I was, blinded by fervor and pride!
Now here I linger. Chained to the memories of a city I had once struggled to escape!
Bound by recollections of those who I could not leave behind.
The irony is not lost on me, mouse!

You, who have encountered a consequence much like my own.
Gripped by raw emotions whose chains bind you, destined to this land.
Shortcomings of the past haunt one and all like whispering phantoms.
An unrewarding battle awaits, culminating in a path of no return.
A perpetuity of struggles begetting more of the same.
We are a pair who have forfeited everything.

You are stuck in a cycle of wrath and destruction, simple being.
Gripped by raw emotions whose chains bind you, destined to this land.
Shortcomings of the past haunt one and all like whispering phantoms.
Listen. Let this be a warning to you...
An unrewarding battle awaits, culminating in a path of no return.
A perpetuity of struggles begetting more of the same.
Find a way out, if you still can.
