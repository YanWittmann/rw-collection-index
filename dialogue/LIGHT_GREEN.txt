LttM: It's an old conversation log. I seem to be in it, but I can't recall much. Let me read it to you:
1650.800 - PRIVATE\nFive Pebbles, Chasing Wind, Big Sis Moon, No Significant Harassment
CW: this is in confidence, but apparently a pseudonym "Erratic Pulse" has appeared on a nearby Silverist conversation with ideas about personal ascension. Someone here in our vicinity is trying to cross themselves out.
=== FP
FP: Where did you hear this?
NSH: I wish them super good luck in that endeavor. How is it going to happen?\nHave the overseers gnaw through bedrock until their entire can crashes down in the void sea?
BSM: Please be respectful when speaking of the Void Sea. Grey Wind, where did you hear this?
CW: I really shouldn't say. He's going to attempt some sort of breeding program. Thought you might want to know.
