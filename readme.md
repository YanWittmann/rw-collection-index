The Rain World Collection Index is a React web application
created to help players explore and keep track of the lore in the game
[Rain World](https://store.steampowered.com/app/312520/Rain_World/).
It provides a centralized place to browse and read all Pearls and Broadcasts
from the vanilla version and the Downpour DLC.
