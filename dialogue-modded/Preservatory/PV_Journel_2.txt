I have devoted my life to the study of the creatures whom we share this plane of existence with.
As a society, we are unique in our mastery over the composition of life. Yet in spite of this,<LINE>we seek to escape from the plane, to leave our far flung siblings and progeny behind.
Do the others not see the shackles we have made for ourselves? That, in our aimless pursuit of an idealized escape,<LINE>we have corrupted our land, poisoned our waters, and left our creations to howl and rot in the debris!
And yet this previous behavior somehow wasn't ENOUGH of an obscenity, and we continued on to sully the landscape with UNHOLY BEACONS of concrete and steel,<LINE>to automate the DESTRUCTION of our SACRED PLANE and forever contemplate a problem on an UNFOUNDED BASIS, ALL SO THAT WE MAY SPEND THE REST OF OUR DAYS<LINE>BICKERING UNTIL OUR TERMINATION WHILE OUR CHILDREN TOIL IN OUR DETRITUS AND OUR GHOSTS MOURN THE IRREVERSIBLY SCARRED CANVAS OF WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN!!!
...
No matter what I might do, I can tell that my allotted time here is drawing to an end.<LINE>If only there was a way to diminish the scars on this world in my absence.
