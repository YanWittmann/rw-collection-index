I would insist it was a dream if i could not recall it so vividly
An unnatural chill engulfed the city block, and from amidst the blanket of silence, a haunting melody emanated.
In my mind I heard a whisper, one which rose into a cacophony filled with the anguish and regret of all existence.
I have previously known of the rumors, but to see it with my own eyes, FEEL it within the core of my being…
The departure we so haphazardly fling ourselves toward is no true escape.
