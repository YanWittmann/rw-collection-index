These are the final operating logs of a transit control tower.\nThey regulated the inbound and outbound traffic of shipments to and from Pebbles and Moon's facilities.
The terrain around their facility became treacherous after water vapor spread everywhere, so most transit exited their retaining wall though a series of aerial railways.
I don't know if many of these trains are working anymore. Maybe that's how you got here?
Though the surroundings outside their wall may be mostly composed of mud and ruins, this is not true of places farther away from here.
I've heard of tall mountains in the north, covered in snow at their peaks.
There is not much to the south or the east from here, only a vast expanse of water.
West is where No Significant Harassment and Seven Red Suns stand.
That's pretty much all I know of the world, my overseers don't reach very far.
