It's an asset management log containing the historic structural health of various pieces of framework over the span of many hundreds of cycles.
What is very interesting about these logs is that all the machinery is still intact!
You see, most standing architecture has been infused with microbes with self-regenerating properties.\nThis is of utmost importance due to the sheer intensity of the weather now.
There were a lot more buildings on my island before, but rain washed them away and erosion did the rest of the work.
The urban settlement west of me is an exception though. A true feat of engineering.\nHigh towers with strong, waterproof foundations. A complex drainage system. An underground stormwater storage... The list goes on.
It is still standing, even after all its residents gone.
