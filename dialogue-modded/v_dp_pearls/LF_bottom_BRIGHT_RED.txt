It's a Small Plate, a little text of spiritual guidance. It was written by a monk called Four Cabinets, Eleven Hatchets. It's pretty old, several ages before the Living Rock rush and the Void Fluid revolution.
Like most writing from this time it’s quite shrouded in analogies, but the subject is how to shed one of the five natural urges which tie a creature to life. Namely number four, gluttony.
It is basically an instruction on how to starve yourself on herbal tea and gravel, but disguised as a poem. On this island, herbal tea was replaced by moss infusions. Moss here was widely known for the distinct pink coloration it gave to the beverage.
Eventually Void Fluid was discovered and those methods, along with many more, were proven obsolete. Even the painful baths of Living Rock were considered a better alternative to some of these traditions. It was just faster, and more definitive.
But some were afraid of not entirely "crossing the river" and getting stuck in this plane of existence.
So gravel, herbal tea and moss infusions stayed popular for a long time.
