This is a conversation log, all plain text. I can read it to you.
"1681.662 - PRIVATE\nSeven Red Suns, Chasing Wind
CW: Have you had any contact with Five Pebbles recently?
SRS: Not in a long while actually! Unless worrying about him counts.
CW: One of his neighbors, Unparalleled Innocence, sent an overseer to his can and got some images. They were made public in the local group, in an effort to be mean I suppose. There's no other way of putting it - he looks awful.
SRS: Tell me.
CW: He's got the rot, very badly. Big cysts have become mobile and are scattering down the west and middle legs. He does listen to you, and few others by now, so you should talk to him.
SRS: I will try to contact him. Does Moon know?
CW: Moon has been unavailable for some time."
I remember this conversation. I wouldn't wish the rot on my worst enemy.
Unfortunately, Pebbles isn't the only one who has it.
The others are just more discreet about it.
...
The rot is not the only affliction we iterators can contract. Take my microbial infection, for example.
Iterator diseases are still very rare, and my illness is mostly due to my unique geographical situation.
There are far more severe afflictions though, and many fringe cases.
I could tell you all about the grey decay, but I don't want to see your last meal on the floor of my chamber.
