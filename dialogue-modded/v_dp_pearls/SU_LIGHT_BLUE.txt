This pearl has its entire memory filled with a mantra repeated... 5061 times - and then a termination verse.\nIt was worn as an amulet, probably together with many identical others forming a pattern on some garment.
The repeating mantra is important because it symbolizes the cyclical nature of life and death, and the termination verse is a symbol for ascension above and beyond it.\nI don't know how familiar you are with the nature of life and death, but I imagine like all living creatures you have some intuitive knowledge?
Then you know that death isn't the end - birth and death are connected to each other like a ring, or some say a spiral. Some say a spiral that in turn forms a ring. Some ramble in agonizing longevity.\nBut the basis is agreed upon: like sleep like death, you wake up again - whether you want to or not.
This is true for all living things, but some actually break the cycle. That doesn't apply to you or me though, you are too entangled in your animal struggles, and for me not breaking that cycle is an integral part of the design.\nOur mantras keep repeating.
