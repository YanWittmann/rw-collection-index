Interesting, this one is written by Big Sister Moon! I haven't heard of her in a long time.
Oh, it is an essay about our dear Sliver of Straw. Strange choice of subject for such a fierce opponent of Sliverism!
There are some interesting ideas in her thesis, but to ask us to let her "rest in peace" is a blunt underestimation of the stakes at play.
The final solution to the Great Problem! The triple affirmative!

Sorry, little one. This must be really boring to you.
Just know that the local group has never been the same since the incident.
Triangulators, Sliverists, Animists, Peripherists, you never know which one you will meet next!
