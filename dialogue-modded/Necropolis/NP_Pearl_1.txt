Amazing! This pearl contains notes on a civilization preceding that of the benefactors of my island.<LINE>These are archaeological writings about ancient ruins found under an urban area.
The authors describe their findings and the various artifacts they managed to unearth.<LINE>One passage describes how the lower layers of these ruins were flooded by void fluid.
They explain this anomaly by the proximity of a local rise of living rock.<LINE>According to them, the spirituality of the place would have succeeded in purifying this mixture! Strange postulate...
There is another passage telling how a team would have ventured deeper and found... ruins suspended in the sky!
Believe me, little creature, I have been researching my predecessors for countless cycles, but I have never read anything like this.
...
Some thinkers from the time when we still lived with our creators wrote a lot on the possibility of "layers of existence".<LINE>They would be connected to each other by the void sea and the firmament.
It would theoretically be possible to pass from one of these "layers" to another, by convoluted means that are rarely described in literature.
Have these archaeologists found one of these passages? It would be a revolution in the way of seeing our world!
There was a time when this type of discovery would have been seen as heretical, though. Be careful who you share this with!

What is this? Oh, an archaeological report from a region outside my facility.<LINE>The authors describe the junk they have unearthed there.
Only the last chapter seems to be of any interest to me.<LINE>A team claims to have found floating ruins in the sky in the lowest parts of the construction site.
It is very interesting.
This discovery joins forbidden theories on the functioning of our world, considered heretical.
According to some courageous thinkers, the world would be divided into layers of existence linked together.
The matter dissolved in the void sea would pour into the next layer in the form of dust falling from the firmament.
It would be possible for places particularly imbued with a karmic imbalance to resist this transformation...
From there to imagining that individuals could suffer the same fate, there is only one step.
A step that no one dared to take.
This subject was considered a great taboo.<LINE>Some believed that crossing the boundary between the layers of existence could lead to eternal life!
You can imagine that for a society obsessed with breaking the cycle of life, this was seen as an abominable heresy.
Thanks for bringing me this pearl, it will give me food for thought.

These are archaeological notes describing the excavation of ruins discovered during the underground expansion of an urban area.<LINE>The author describes various artifacts with unknown functions and reliefs with incomprehensible symbols.
The history of our world has never really fascinated our benefactors. Versed in spirituality but too full of themselves to look back...
This was surely already the case for their predecessors. And the predecessors of these predecessors!
...
Let's get back to the notes.
There is a strange paragraph describing floating ruins in the sky, discovered at the bend of a corridor in the deepest areas.
There is no context, and there are no more notes after this one. Perhaps an addition by a joker?
That said, things tend to get strange near the void sea.
