This is a description of the various processes of a textile factory.
Or rather, let me tell you a short story about them.
Textile factories were massive, mostly autonomous, and filled with purposed organisms, and none were more infamous than the silk-producing aquatic threader worm.
Long before such organisms became the norm, artisans relied on what they could find in nature.
They cultivated cactus-like plants, extracting their sap and spinning it into thread.
These threads were then woven into tapestries detailing the life of the weaver and their family, a meticulous craft that could take generations.
Then came the threader worm, and its efficient, resistant, waterproof silk. Tradition stood no chance.
Angered, the cactus weavers disrupted factories, staging desperate protests. But as their numbers dwindled, so did their legacy.
In the end, such was the fate of many things.
...
The moral of the story?
I'm not sure.

This describes the process of a textile industry plant.
Threader worms are bred in gigantic vats. When they reach maturity, they are segregated into small water-filled cubic boxes.
Here, they excrete thin silk threads for the rest of their lives.
The threads are then woven into fabric and dyed by various other purposed organisms, without much worker involvement.
The resulting fabric was of such high quality that it rarely frayed. It had many applications, from fashion to sky sail making.
Did you know it was also used for making iterator garments? We don't really need those, but I guess it made us more... relatable.
