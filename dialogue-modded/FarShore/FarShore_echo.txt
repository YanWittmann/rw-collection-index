Finally we meet.
I am honored by your presence, little one.
Tell me, what do you seek here?
For there is nothing left to see. I was wrong.
The unknown is elsewhere, beyond the wretched remains of this world.
You come from a place so vast. I envy you.
Go now, for there is nothing left to say.

Greetings, fellow traveller!
Take a moment and admire these vistas of uncharted lands, isn't it a sight to behold?
How could we have the will to explore its inner self when the call of the wild expanses is so thunderous?
I pity monks and scholars, deaf to the great song of the outdoors. I followed them, but at what end?
This was a late lesson, but I learned my place was here, forever lingering for adventure.
My existence will always be one of a fierce explorer, in search for a splinter of their glorious ambition.
I hope you'll find the peace I relinquished, little creature.
