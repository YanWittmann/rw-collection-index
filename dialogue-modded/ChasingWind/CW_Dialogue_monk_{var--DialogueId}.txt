Greetings, little visitor!
...
How curious... I haven't met your kind for countless cycles, and now... two in a row?
...
Maybe the previous one was... family? Let me see...
...
Indeed! A quick isotopic analysis suggests you are also native to somewhere beyond Five Pebbles territory.
Fascinating... Have you been following its tracks?
Excuse such intrusiveness, I have grown deeply involved in the study of the life of this land.
My peers would definitely disapprove of such interests!
It seems one of my neighbors has already bestowed you the gift of communication though! This is a surprising privilege for a small lifeform like you.
Well, you are here now! Welcome to my small island, a perfect place of peace and leisure!
...
I'm joking, things are only getting worse. Especially with neighbors like mine.
Your presence here is refreshing from the constant quarrels of the local group.
Please take the time to rest, you're safe here.
...
I have to apologize for the mess, my bacteria colonies are spewing sulfur everywhere...
You probably met them on your way here, they're hard to miss.
I'm in the middle of cleaning up, trying to contain them in my memory conflux for now.
I did some experiments with the local life, using it to keep the sulfur eaters in check.
My immune system is holding on for now, surprisingly.
It allowed me to try unconventional computations, more... organic algorithms.
...
Anyway, enough about me!
I'm afraid I can't offer you much right now.
I believe this small gift should help you find what you seek.
You must have noticed the peculiarity of being tethered to this physical world, waking up again and again.
I sometimes wish I was a little beast like you, because you have a way out.
Follow the old path. Go to the north-west, past the overgrown farms.
Then down into the earth, where the rock boils, go as deep as you can reach.
You're resourceful, I'm sure you'll find your way.
...
You can exit my structure by using the access shaft on the left.
I will now resume my work, there is much to be done.
