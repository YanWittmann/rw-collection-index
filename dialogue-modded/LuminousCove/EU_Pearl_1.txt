This is an invitation to a light show, a way to inaugurate the end of my construction!
The event took place under my structure, in a large committee composed of the most influential citizens of the island, and numerous delegations from abroad.
Some had expressed the whim to attend aboard their luxury watercrafts.
A canal was then dug to allow them privileged access from the ocean.
The party was memorable and it is said that the celebrations were visible from everywhere in the local group.
The canal, poorly constructed, slowly eroded and transformed into a cove.
And since the bioluminescence has now become omnipresent in the shadow of my structure,<LINE>I get to remember my first moments every time I want to observe local life.

Oh yes, it is an invitation to the commissioning of Chasing Wind.
I remember this frivolity. Light shows. It illuminated the entire local group for many cycles.
What a strange decision for people who prided themselves on their austerity and spirituality.
Many made the trip despite this, coming from far and wide. But some simply refused to send any delegation.
It is hard to blame them. Such lavish festivities clearly show a total denigration of their roots.
That said, I remember feeling pleased at the thought of having an additional correspondent with whom to share my theories.

This is a cordial message inviting anyone who reads it to the inauguration of Chasing Wind.
It was a very popular event among our benefactors, even compared to previous inaugurations.
It must be said that the organizers had a sense of spectacle!\nNothing had been spared to please the delegations.
It seems that some who made the trip came from across the ocean.\nPerhaps citizens of a completely different group of iterators?
Although many shared a certain spirituality, you must understand that our benefactors were a diverse group with many cultures and divergent opinions.
Succeeding in bringing them together in such a way was deemed impossible by many!
