In the end, I truly had no meaning.
The world won't remember me. Everything that made what\nwe know up is now gone. Lost to time.
And yet... That truly is everything.
We are nothing. We are\ntiny specks in this great endless cycle.
But we are alive! And as long as we live,\nwe will forever turn nothing into something!
In the end, I truly had no meaning!\nI was free to do as I pleased!
Embrace the nothingness, little one!\nFor you are everything!

You hold a purpose.
And yet... Does it make you feel any better?
Raw anger, a cruel lust for violence.
Does the world make you angry, too?\nI always hoped that the world would change.
I was foolish, of course, for it is an unstoppable machine.\nNever changing, never ending. It existed long before us, and\nit will outlive us far into a future we won't comprehend.
We aren't born for a reason. Our existance is meaningless,\nand in the big cycle of the world, we are nothing.
So do whatever you please. Break free from your mortal bindings, my friend.\nGo after the goal that fuels your heart.

You hold a purpose.
You weren't made out of nothing.\nEvery part of your organism was designed with a goal in mind.
There were no random factors involved in your creation.\nYou exist for a reason.
And yet... Does it make you feel any better?
We come into this world wrapped in flesh and bones.\nWe come empty handed, and so we leave too.
We aren't born for a reason. Our existance is meaningless,\nand in the big cycle of the world, we are nothing.
Why does anything matter, then? What are we\nsupposed to do within our mortality?
You cannot talk. And yet I know...
I... understand, little creature. Thank you.

Why are you here, little one?
What holds you tethered to this world?\nIs it the comfort of your own flesh? Or the fear of letting go of it?
I was once just like you. A creature stuck inside my own mortality.
But I was meant to be great! I was celebrated! I created marvelous things,\ngreater than myself! My name was known across the land!
And look at me now. Sitting cycle after cycle in this place.
Forgotten, meaningless.\nJust another sacrifice in it's path.
Nothing mattered in the end.
