[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Unstable Daydream, Twelve Stars Above
NSCP-TSA: So No Significant Harassment is right.
NSCP-TSA: We have to find another way to communicate. One that lasts longer than our rusty metal spires.
NSCP-UD: I think so.
NSCP-UD: we have to accept it. We are getting old. If we don't find a way, we will spend most of our cycles left thinking about the past.
NSCP-UD: And we can't ever go back to that, my friend.
NSCP-TSA: We cannot go back to our past. We can simply move forward.
NSCP-UD: At least we'll have each other.
NSCP-UD: We won't be alone - we don't have to be.
