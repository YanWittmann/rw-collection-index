How interesting. This pearl is truly a piece of art as a whole,\nsuch details, such art engraved onto one single pearl...
The ancestors to our creators, who once populated this\ndance are known across us iterators for their affinity at building with\nsuch detail and thought, preparing their creations\nfor a future thousands of cycles beyond their own.
Even in the era where the clouds obscured the ground, and cities above giant metal cans\nwere now populated, the appreciation for creating things was never lost.
This pearl even seems to contain an old version of what was a\nsong revered in my own city. A tune that... Now almost seems nostalgic.
Thank you, I will keep this in my archives.

This pearl has an intricate design, most likely meant\nto be an ornament or a piece of art on it's own.
There seems to be a series of musical pieces written down on it.\nMusic! This compositions and details seem quite old... Perhaps older than anything you've seen, including me.
I wonder, do you understand what music is?
A series of sounds that together sound pleasant to your mind, I wonder\nif other organisms were capable of such expression, too!
My creators, or rather, my creators ancestors, had a good taste\nfor creating wonders such like this!
Conversation groups have revolved around the conservation and appreciation\nof now lost and irreplaceable pieces of art and history, made in a different\nera with different intent, yet, some of it having being kept through time.
I wish I could share this pearl with the local group! I'm sure someone would appreciate it.
I sadly can't translate this into audible, understandable noise. Such\ntreasures lost in the troubles of translation and communication...
