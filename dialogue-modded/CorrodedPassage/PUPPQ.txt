[RECORDED BROADCAST : 1645.122] - PRIVATE Unstable Daydream, Twelve Stars Above
NSCP-TSA: Alright, what have you been working on? I've heard a thing or two, but you are very cryptic about it!
NSCP-TSA: You... Haven't found a solution, have you?
NSCP-UD: Oh, my friend. I gave up on that a long time ago!
NSCP-TSA: Wait... What?
NSCP-UD: I've been experimenting with purposed organisms. They truly are amazing when it comes to fulfilling a mission!
NSCP-UD: It seems that Seven Red Suns was right. I see it now. Perhaps I could train my own messanger.
NSCP-UD: Our facilities aren't that far away, after all!~
NSCP-TSA: Interesting.
NSCP-TSA: So, let me process this. Did you really stop looking for a solution to our great burden?
NSCP-UD: We will all collapse, eventually. The rest of my facility looks older and older each time I decide to look at it.
NSCP-UD: I'd like to use my time a little more wisely, before it's too late.
NSCP-TSA: That is a way to look at it...
