NSCP-FPB: Like I was saying, it's been harder to come across study material nowadays.
NSCP-FPB: Supplies for my projects... I've learned the hard way to truly be as efficient as possible.\nDespite our creators preparing us for their absence, the effect has been noticiable rather... quickly.
NSCP-UD: That's what happens when you don't plan accordingly!~
NSCP-PS: I share that feeling. How hard is it nowadays to work on new projects!
NSCP-PS: Have you heard about No Significant Harassment's little project?
NSCP-UD: The purposed organism? I find it quite interesting.
NSCP-PS: Likewise. I suppose it is a good way to deal with our own inevitable decay.
NSCP-UD: We could send Bones something to work on! I can think of a few things~
NSCP-FPB: Oh please!
NSCP-FPB: I... Like the idea. I wouldn't want to lose contact when we get rusty.
