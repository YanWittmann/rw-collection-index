Where did you find this? This seems to be older than my own structure.
This pearl has plain text written on it. Allow me to read it to you.
"I too, like a ripe fruit, fall, fall, fall to the ground beneath.\nI feel its embrace, hugging my skin, my flesh, my bones with its warmth.\nI fall into my slumber. I lose myself, more, more, and more each time. \nI see the light once more, but my skin, my flesh, my bones, they are left behind.
I am not the same, but I remain. Changed, renewed, not quite the same.
I look behind me, and I see my remains. I look ahead of me, and I see my own self looking back at me from above."
Quite an interesting read. It talks about the unstoppable change that comes with time itself. A cycle, in it's own way.
This will help me endure the passage of time a little better. Thank you.

Where did you find this little creature? This seems to be quite old, perhaps as old as my own structure.
This pearl contains a single poem. I doubt you would find it's\nactual writing interesting, little creature, so allow me to summarize!~
This text talks about the inevitable change\nall things have, and will, go through. It makes a comparison between the writer and a fruit,\ntalking about the recurring cycle that they will go through.
They will go back to the ground, and from the ground, they will come back once more, but not quite the same.
After hundreds of cycles, there is barely any resemblance left of\nwhat originally existed.
I suppose it may be hard to grasp just how much things change.\nThe world around you is a mountain of change after change. You live in the remains of my creator's creations.
I, too, will go back to the ground one day.

...\nI, too, live in the remains of my past.
