I can see a simplified diagram of a water purification plant.\n Two large constructions connected by a bridge of some sort.
One large leg aswell as four smaller legs support the structure in the sky.
It all appears to be quite standard stuff.\n The only thing of note is that it was constructed high in the air.\n Probably a flamboyant way to show off architectural skills, or for a religious purpose perhaps.
A small description details its name as "bright facility"
