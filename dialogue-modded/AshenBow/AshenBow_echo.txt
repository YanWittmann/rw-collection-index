Ah, the irony is not lost on me, creature.
I wished to grasp the stars.\nYet still, I attempted to dive downwards.
The very proof of my longing is what you see before you.
Were the symphonies of the stars drowned out by our cries?\nPerhaps a great silence was necessary for us to finally see.
How unfortunate it only occurred after we left.
You might understand.\nYou too appear bound to this world.
