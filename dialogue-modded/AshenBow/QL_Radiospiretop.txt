It’s a report on the state of the world’s weather and general observations around how the land is\nchanging, including predictions for the future.
It’s a long read and seems to be partially automated.\nThe data on this pearl seems to have been requested by a small group of Iterators in the far north.
From what I can glean from the layout of the data, its only part of a larger array of information.\nIt was likely gathered by satellite and sent down to this pearl, where it was then poorly written due to damage.
It’s very outdated, but the entry essentially states that temperatures are to drop steadily over time.
While I do know that there are many of us out there, and that we provided many different services before\nbecoming what we are now, I had never heard of an Iterator group dedicated to a secondary major cause other than the great problem.
I wonder if they still carry out their duties today?\nI wouldn't blame them if they didn't.
