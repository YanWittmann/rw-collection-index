It seems to hold information concerning the operations and status of a coolant system.
If I am not mistaken, could this be from the small satellite base within the perimeter walls?
Over time, it seems that the containers that kept the coolant secure have eroded,\nthereby exposing the coolant to the air and rapidly freezing the local area over.
Luckily, the amount of frost shouldn’t be enough to massively disrupt the local fauna.\nI’m sure given the circumstances and from what I have observed over the countless cycles, that both\nthe flora and fauna will adapt to the colder climate in due course. Perhaps they have already.
I would imagine that the temperature change is at least survivable for the time being.\nYou certainly seem okay!
