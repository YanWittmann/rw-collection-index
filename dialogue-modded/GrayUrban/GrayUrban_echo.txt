What a hollow place...
It was not always as such. Once, so long ago, every crevice bustled with life.
Even as the tides of civilization rose and fell, some of us clung to what we knew.
Not I. My misgivings led me deeper, and deeper, spiraling endlessly down and down.
Perhaps I was naive to believe such a fate as mine was avoidable, with all that dragged behind me, like snagging debris amongst fronds.
And now, I am all that is left here, aside from the shivering gusts and errant raindrops that dwell within these walls.
And small, damp beasts such as yourself, of course.
