In the end, I truly had no meaning.
The world won't remember me. Everything that made what\nwe know up is now gone. Lost to time.
And yet... That truly is everything.
We are nothing. We are\ntiny specks in this great endless cycle.
But we are alive! And as long as we live,\nwe will forever turn nothing into something!
In the end, I truly had no meaning!\nI was free to do as I pleased!
Embrace the nothingness, little one!\nFor you are everything!

I sense a presence before me.
A small creature, one of countless. An insignificant speck against the infinite.
What does it seek, atop this ruined monolith? This grand feat of mechanical ingenuity, this monument to the virtuosity of our kind..!
...now nothing more than a shard of rubble upon this decaying memory of a landscape...
Does it feel that same carnal urge that I once possessed? The desire to be free of the shackles that bind us to this plane, to travel beyond?
Indeed, there is a way, little one. But here...
I'm afraid you are searching in entirely the wrong place.
