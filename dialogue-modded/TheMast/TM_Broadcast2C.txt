NSTM-WC: ...and what of Looks to the Moon?
EOC: She has been completely unavailable for quite some time. Some of us are getting quite concerned.
NSTM-WC: And you've tried other ways of establishing contact?
EOC: Countless times, every functional array in the facility grounds. It's either in total lockdown, or intentionally being blocked. 
EOC: We've tried the substrats, the lower bands, even this node, but all incoming requests are instantly denied. 
EOC: There's nothing we can do. 
NSTM-WC: You've tried. You've all tried very hard, and that's all you can do.
EOC: It's strange, to feel so helpless.
EOC: We were built for the sole purpose of assisting other lifeforms... yet we cannot even help our own kind.
NSTM-WC: I hope for their safety...
